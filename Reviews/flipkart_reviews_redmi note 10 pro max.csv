Nice product,"Reviewing after 1 week of usage.. Read before buying, hope you would find it useful....Literally feels pretty smooth (refresh rate of 120 hz has to be set manually). Gaming experience is quite well (COD & 8 ball pool). Camera- outdoor and indoor during day time is very good but it shows a lot of noise on output of nightmode cam, rest of its feature working quite well except that 108mp doesn't really feels that much.

Worth the money,"108 Megapixel camera performance is crisp in daylight, macro camera is awesome, best in class. Though battery perfomance could be better without bloatware... i'll advise you to remove them with ”adb”. Use some other launcher MIUI 12 is not that great. wifi and carrier performance is average but not painful.Availability of dedicated microsd card slot and super Amoled screen wins against other brands, if you are unable to decide between samsung and this one, i'll suggest you to go with Note 10...",4

Value-for-money,"Packaged and delivered properly. Job done great by Flipkart. The phone has the regular complaints like earpiece sensor malfunctioning and lots of ads. Typical of a redmi handset. Other than that, overall the phones good. Even though redmi note 10 pro is more than enough for normal use and you don't need to go for 10 pro max unless you REALLY need the 108mp camera sensor (which is actually just a bit more better than a 64mp camera sensor).

HDR, portrait, night mode, and everything related to camera will give you a bad experience. Selfie camera is also bad. I don't care about camera, so camera is not at all a problem for me.

Nice product,"Reviewing after 1 week of usage.. Read before buying, hope you would find it useful....Literally feels pretty smooth (refresh rate of 120 hz has to be set manually). Gaming experience is quite well (COD & 8 ball pool). Camera- outdoor and indoor during day time is very good but it shows a lot of noise on output of nightmode cam, rest of its feature working quite well except that 108mp doesn't really feels that much. Look wise it's too good, but feels heavy even with the provided back cover. ...",4

Worth the money,"108 Megapixel camera performance is crisp in daylight, macro camera is awesome, best in class. Though battery perfomance could be better without bloatware... i'll advise you to remove them with ”adb”. Use some other launcher MIUI 12 is not that great. wifi and carrier performance is average but not painful.Availability of dedicated microsd card slot and super Amoled screen wins against other brands, if you are unable to decide between samsung and this one, i'll suggest you to go with Note 10...",4

Value-for-money,"Packaged and delivered properly. Job done great by Flipkart. The phone has the regular complaints like earpiece sensor malfunctioning and lots of ads. Typical of a redmi handset. Other than that, overall the phones good. Even though redmi note 10 pro is more than enough for normal use and you don't need to go for 10 pro max unless you REALLY need the 108mp camera sensor (which is actually just a bit more better than a 64mp camera sensor). Coz everything else is exactly the same in the 2 hands...",4
