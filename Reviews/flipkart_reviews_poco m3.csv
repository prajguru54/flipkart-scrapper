Don't waste your money,Horrible phoneWhy? 1-It heat up while charging and playing games2- Phone sensitive very less 3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting6-  battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...,1
Not recommended at all,"Its ridiculous, I mean it's seems like a fraud. I m using POCO C3 from 1 year. It's very good till now. But after delivery of POCO M3 its battery seems like 3000mAh, it's finger print sensor is worst, It's speakers sound is good. It's hang all the time. It's RAM management is very poor. I don't know what happening in POCO. Go for other smartphone or little bit upgrade your budget.",1
Absolute rubbish!,"Why flipkart you cancel orders , don't advertise product when you can't fulfill delivery. You waste our time, efforts and keep hold of money for no reason",1
Horrible,"I got this phone on sunday...looking at positive reviews(which i now believe were all framed) on monday i made my first call and the other party was not able to hear my voice so i asked for replacement, after lot of hardwork I somehow was able to return this phone. My advice is simple - please don't buy this cheap quality phone.",1
Terrible product,Camera - 48 mp rear is average and front 8mp is worse performance Battery - 4 hour to full charge and it's dry ( empty) also fast ... 6000 mah battery !  Worse Mi all app auto update ( I stopped in play store) but without permission...Xiaomi day by day get bad image  :(,1
Did not meet expectations,Nothing much impressive. Its your own risk,1

Unsatisfactory ... Worst Camera...,Camera is very poor . Main thing about the front camera.... very pathetic video quality for whatsup calls.... very disappointment with the camera....,1
Worst experience ever!,Camera quality is poor and performance also not up to the mark so am raised a return request but Flipkart tram simply calling per day 2 calls wasting our time and money as well so they will not accept return simply they drag till 7 days replacement policy then say it's over.. so don't buy it's worst experience for me,1
Worst experience ever!,Ghtiya phone. Battery life like 4000 MHDisplay very slow  like 2007 generationsPlease don't buyMoney westing phone,1
Not recommended at all,Third class mobile... Waste of money,1
Did not meet expectations,Phone is not good please don't purchase any time bugs and errors was coming,1

Wonderful,"I received my Poco M3 today (delivered by Ekart in 2 days).

Classy product,"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....",5
Value-for-money,Bought this one for normal use and its Great. Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...,4
Wonderful,"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...",4
Fabulous!,"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product.

You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5

It is not even  good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very  good  but display  is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
Not good,If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung). This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect. A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Does the job,"The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor... The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger. When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal.. I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3
Pretty good,"This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.Camera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp.

Delightful,"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con: 1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2.

Terrific,"One word review "" Value for Money""It has the potential to be a nice casual daily driverSpeakers are loud...like seriously loud.Screen size is goodThough being a LCD screen it produces decent colours. For the price at which it comes that more than enough.Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.6000 mA battery 🔋👍🏻Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)Finally the Verdict is that it'...",5

Simply awesome,"Mobile is good... I bought the yellow one... Front and rear cameras are good too... But the con is pics aren't tht clear when we zoom in a lot...the picture quality is too good for short range pics as you can see... The first one or the buildings one is taken with max zoom... No heating issues with battery or while charging.... I use it for browsing, listening songs, to read books texting and calling... So on a single charge I can use it for two days... With apporx 18hrs of usage of above act...",5
Wonderful,1. Phone is perfect but Camera it's not good. 2. In this price we get many best feature but Charging is bit slow.3. For low budget it is the perfect mobile phone.,4

Worth the money,"The phone is quite good and value for money.* Camera is kind of okay, can't complaint while considering the price.* Battery is above average, will stand for at least one and a half day for normal use. For heavy user's, I think it might stand for one day.* Display is IPS LCD display which work's very well and the quality is good for the price; also it is best display in among LCD .* Performance is satisfying, the Chipset handle's daily tasks smoothly and as this is a mid-range Chipset ...",4

This phone has very minor lags.This has Good battery life , decent processor , durable and excellent designAs per the specification camera is the worst in this phonebut the photo quality is good and better if clicked via gcam 8.1 apk64 gb is good but 128 gb is better for Poco m3 because it has UFS 2.2 , this can increase the phone speed a little bit.Display is decent for this price.

Classy product,"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....",5
Value-for-money,Bought this one for normal use and its Great. Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...,4
Wonderful,"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...",4
Fabulous!,"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
Does the job,Honest review after 1 week useNegative point1.low quality camera like 8mp2.battery not 6000mah it's like 4500mah3.Slow charging 100% charge take 5.5h4.Ram not 6gb it's like 4.5gbOverall good,3

Pretty good,Phone looks sturdy and the display is great...sound is the best thing about the phone...buttons are nicely placed. front camera is not so good..but back camera is nice. overall a nice phone,4
Expected a better product,After around 1 month of usage-Even though its a budget phone the intial days Mi Note  3 worked well than this. It sometimes get hanged and when I tried to download a 1 gb file from internet. It restarted itself.So performance wise not good.Nothing is great. Can't have a Google feed normally also.Feeling likw giving it back,2

Decent product,"Selfie camera was 👎Respected buyers mobile outlook was fantastic , but if u want good camera quality don't buy these mobile..Camera quality was too low Don't buy if u look good camera mobile",3
Worthless,POCO M3 is good  phone  but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display  is very  bad many times  its display  gave the some  issues. It is not even  good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very  good  but display  is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
Not good,If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung). This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect. A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Value-for-money,Good mobile poco m3 pros. 6000 mah battery and and avarage weight. once word review ' value for money ' But  Ram not 6 Gb but its like 4.5 Gb.and also very very slow charging capacity 100% carved take  minimum 5/6 hours.

Does the job,"The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor... The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger. When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal.. I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3
Pretty good,"This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.Camera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp. Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best..",4
Delightful,"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con: 1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4
Must buy!,Nice phone I have buy in my life. IT is a super phone. I had watched  some reviews on Flipkart they are saying selfie camera is very poor but my Poco m3 has a funtastic selfie and back camera.In this price range it is a super phone.I am using it for 10 days and I am saying this review.Its performance is super,5
