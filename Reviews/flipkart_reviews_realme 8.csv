Worst experience ever!,Camera quality is not good. The zoom picture of photos taken are not clear visible. My six years old mobile of other brand with 13MP rare camera had a very good zoom clarity. Not sure why we have 64 MP here with 4 rare camera when zoom is not good.,1

Super!,A great phone if we remove camera qualityEverything is great at the price range  of 13500But camera should be improved It's like 64mp is just for name as 64mpFlagships 13 mp is better than thisOtherwise everything is at its high for nowI am little bit disappointed with the camera,5
Must buy!,Overall a very good and affordable phine in its segment. It's an alrounder.Things to consider: Speakers can be sometimes mushy and not enough loud.Micro sd card detection bugs are there may be it will get resolved in upcoming updates.

Unsatisfactory,"Worst phone that you can get on 16k. No one , I mean no one should consider buying this phone. This phone is way to slow and very bad processor. It's only been 10 days but it feels like 2 years old phone. My honor 6x plus which is from 2015 was way more better than this one even today. I highly request people to not to buy this product.

Useless product,Wo,1
Really Nice,"Decent product at this price segment,brave investment as a long term especially in terms of durability and reflective design ,storage ( but if you don't want durability ) , then you can go for redmi note 10 pro, which is far better option but still realme phones are far better than other handsets in durability",4

Fair,Nothing special as compared to predesor realms 7 accept super amoled display and in display fingerprint scanner but refresh rate is been downgraded. The back panel in fingerprint and dust magnet. Mono speaker but still produces decent output. phone is getting heated after camera uses this is quite unusual. Network reception is fine. Camera is ok ok..the other 2 lenses are just to make it quad camera setup.Display - 9/10Camera - 7/10.Build - 8/10,3

Worst experience ever!,Camera quality is not good. The zoom picture of photos taken are not clear visible. My six years old mobile of other brand with 13MP rare camera had a very good zoom clarity. Not sure why we have 64 MP here with 4 rare camera when zoom is not good.,1

Fabulous!,"Writing this review after 20 days of usage so here are some features which I found really good in this device is a good quality amoled display sporting under display fingerprint scanner, it gives around 1 day battery backup after full charge..not to forget it has 30watt dart charging technology which charges the Device very quickly.

Nice,"Got the phone today and after using for some time here's my review the display is excellent no doubt, it is in par with other amoled phones. I cannot talk about battery backup yet so, leaving that part. The downsides I am facing right now are camera video stabilization is very very bad, I mean the video is better when there's no stabilization, I seriously hope they fix this issue in future update and front camera gives soft images looks like 2 MP images.Will update my review here if future ...",3

Must buy!,Nice camera but need improvement.Performance also good i recommend to choose 6 gb ram variant. Actually no need of 2 mega pixel macro camera primary is doing good in macro shots.,5
Must buy!,"After using realme 7 from last 6 months I finally decided to upgrade my smartphone and purchased realme 8 last week. After using it for a week now, I can say that the build quality of the phone has improved a lot. The display quality has also improved a lot. realme 8 is very slim and light weight compared to its previous generation phone realme 7. Camera is also very good and even the battery life is very good. I want to thank flipkart delivery team for super fast delivery as always.",5

Really Nice,"It is a great product. sAmoled display with turbo charger with 5000mah batteey backup. Awesome. But no stereo speaker. If you have no problem with miui then go for redmi note 10. But miui 12 is filled with some bugs, and bloatware, on the otherhand realme ui is one of the best ui after Samsun ui. So think before choosing between these two. Also the antutu acore is also good of this realme 8. It is near poco x3. So u can go for it. But if u are looking for Snapdragon chipset, then it is not fo...",4
Beyond Expectations!,"This phone directly competes with Redmi Note 10 and (in my opinion) Wins!Looks, form factor, build quality, weight everything is great.User interface is clean and smooth to use.Camera quality, different camera modes and filters add up to the experience.As of April 2021, this is the Best phone money can buy in the range of 15K, period.",5
Just wow!,"Posting this after 3 weeks usage. (Previously I owned Poco M2 Pro)PROS:Screen: Great amoled screen, gets pretty bright for outdoor usage. Colours are vivid with good viewing angles. Not a fast refresh screen but UI is smoother than Xiaomi phones so it feels almost same. Dragontrail glass protection is similar to Gorilla Glass 5.Processor: GPU performance is great.

Fabulous!,Top notch performance camera images r too punchy but it can be  fixed through updates or by using gcam Display is good bright and colourful therefore its value for money u can go for it,5
Super!,A great phone if we remove camera qualityEverything is great at the price range  of 13500But camera should be improved It's like 64mp is just for name as 64mpFlagships 13 mp is better than thisOtherwise everything is at its high for nowI am little bit disappointed with the camera,5
Must buy!,Overall a very good and affordable phine in its segment. It's an alrounder.Things to consider: Speakers can be sometimes mushy and not enough loud.Micro sd card detection bugs are there may be it will get resolved in upcoming updates. Otherwise a great deal and product happy with delivery service as well,5
