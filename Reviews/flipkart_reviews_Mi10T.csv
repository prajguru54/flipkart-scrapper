Highly recommended,"Superb performance and looks premium. The only thing i dont like about this phone is its display. Those who want for gaming its the best in this price range you will get 90fps by default..Camera is great, night photos are very clear even without nightmode..8k video is unbeatable..Edit oct 5th 2021, After updates MIUI lags but that's happen to every android phone after 6 monthREAD MORE",5
Very Good,I received this two days ago. I'm satisfied with the performance of the mobile but extremely disappointed with the behavior of delivery person. Completely unprofessional and annoying. I got this phone with an exchange of my almost new mobile. But from the beginning his intentions was very clear to me. He took almost 30 minutes to check my old mobile He checked screen in my room then went out to check again in sunlight. Tried to pull the screen guard off but failed. I helped him to pull it of...READ MORE,4
Perfect product!,"Awesome!!I have switched from LG G6 to this device. This my first Mi device so I had some kind of uneasiness while purchasing it but offer was too good to resist. First impression: It is very premium device! Solid metal frame with glass back in Lunar silver color looks Stunning...Display: there was to much debate around display of this phone, though amoleds are good for battery and color reproduction, this display is also sharp! It is NOT a cheap lcd...Performance: Daily tasks are butt...READ MORE",5

Super!,"Its a great performing phone at the given price. The display is a little disappointing but its not very bad. The camera takes crisp shots, the portrait mode is great. The selfies come out really nice and vibrant. The processor does its job to the perfection. No heating issues, the charging is quick and the battery stays after a long day of calls, continuous WiFi and whole lot of things. The phone though is a bit bulky  because of the huge battery it doesn't cause discomfort as such. Overall i...READ MORE",5
Just wow!,Awesome performance great experience smooth game play. Good battery life and value for money.Display is not the best.READ MORE,5
Classy product,"Mi10t has all the features which I was looking for. Amazing Camera, IR blaster, NFC, good battery backup, 5G support , refresh rate upto 144Hz and awesome performance.Also there's no ads in this phone. The only con is Google dialler, I really liked MI stock dialler but lot of new Android phones like Nord, realme are coming with Google dialler only.Also even though the display is not AMOLED but the LCD is super high quality and I love it. Far far better than other phones in this segment.READ MORE",5

Highly recommended,Flipkart delivery is fast and first time they accepted my exchange mobile without any fuss. Mi10t is good but too much hype around mi10i makes me wonder about my decision. I wish mi10 t had a better display and ui like one plusREAD MORE,5
Value-for-money,"Very good mobile but I'm  disappointed amoled display,but very good display rather than other LED display it's true colour eye protection no eye training display,That charger not like speed I mean 50 or 65 watt.But it's a flagship performance beasting like blazeDon't think agar redmi it's a XIAOMI mobile man#865 5G team.READ MORE",4
Honest experience.,"I've been using this phone for around 20 days now and I think that's quite enough to give my feedback. So Mi 10t is so great when it comes to hardware, say SD865,144HZ (i know its lcd, but I'll talk about it later)display, 5g support, NFC, UFS 3.1, LPDDR5 RAM, 33w charger(it's quite good, takes almost an hour) and the battery life is also great (gives me around 7 hours SOT with 90hz refresh rate and 5 hours with 144 hz). Coming to the software, I personally haven't found any major bugs in t...READ MORE",5
Perfect product!,"Been using this device for 2 days now.Has been checking out the battery drain and backup on this phone.With the display set to 144hz I got 6hrs50min of SOT.Pubg 3hrs50min,YouTube 2hrs,rest web browsing.pubg was played at 90fps.Is the screen on time good by today's standards?Battery conservation at 144hz feels better than with the display set to 90hz.Performance is good with good heat dissipation through backside during extended gaming sessions.READ MORE",5
Awesome,Initial impressions are great!Edit (after a week) : Performance is smooooth. MiUi is really well optimized for this device. Gaming is superb! Display is a top quality LCD panel so no problem with that. I haven't tested the camera much but the pics I took were looking good to me. The in-hand feel is really premium as the frame is of aluminium and the front and back is glass.  Speakers are clear and adequately loud. So overall I've enjoyed this device till now 🤩READ MORE,5
Just wow!,"If you are gonna buy this phone for pubg . It's awesome.It can't give 90fps constant but it can give 60fps constant.For best , game performance,If you want to play pubg at 60fps constant ,first change the adaptive refresh rate to 60hz . It's not mandatory to change the refresh rate to 60hz but you can see the difference, playing the game in (144hz,90hz) and 60hz. However pubg doesn't support 144hz.You will get to see fps drops , when you play the game at (144hz or 90hz) refresh rate but ...READ MORE",5
Really Nice,"Terrific purchase.I have upgraded from one plus 7 to try Xiaomi and choose 10T, and i wont regret the purchase.Pros:1. Operation was buttery smooth with 144hz refresh rate.2. RAM management is considerably ok with MIUI 123. Camera quality is good.4. Battery backup is supergood and charging is pretty fast.Cons: IPS display.NOTE: I like AMOLED screens as they look beautiful in every aspect.However, Xiomi did a great job in providing the best quality display.READ MORE",4
Wonderful,"Great camera. Decent display. Performance was quiet good, there was heating problem. When I play pubg, after three matches the phone temperature increases 50 degree. Oh my god. No laging. Over all it is good. Not best.Battery was great 😊READ MORE",5
Mi 10t is a 5G flagship phone at a great price.,"I was quite confused before buying this phone due to lack of ample reviews and even then most of the reviews are confusing. May be people who are giving negative or 2-star, 3-star reviews, are comparing this phone in their own ways.But must I say this, Mi 10t is a 5G flagship phone at a great price. First of all, you get the flagship processor SD 865 which doesn't need any intro or feedback. It is the fastest processor by Snapdragon till date, apart from SD 888 which is present only in ult...READ MORE",5
Perfect product!,Battery is good. Multitasking with SD865 with 5G support and 8gigs of RAM is sufficient to run any apps at this price range. Should have been Amoled display but still FHD+ display has good viewing angles. Overall a good buy at this price point.READ MORE,5
Perfect product!,"An excellent phone under 30k segment (after exchange), the display is pretty good for an LCD, but the performance is absolutely phenomenonal144hz display along with adaptive sync is smoooth and efficient on battery as wellCamera are pretty good, also has support for gcam mods so you can always extract more from itThe charging is not that fast but it lasts pretty long so I don't really mind, also if I have to charge overnight I charge using a slow 10w charger to preserve battery longetiv...READ MORE",5
Brilliant,"Great phone. Got it for a great price of 25k. With extra 5k off on exhange offer. At this price, this phone is a great steal. And no doubt, this phone has great performance. Also bought it with fixed exchange price of 24.5k for one year. So its a win win for me.READ MORE",5
Brilliant,"Been using it for 10 days now. I have not seen any performance lag. However face detection is a bit slow. But can be dealt with. Awesome camera, decent battery life, excellent charging speed which is wonderful. Feels good in hands. Nice to watch videos, movies, etc. Screen quality at par with Amoled but with a little differenceREAD MORE",5
Best in the market!,"Everything is awesome except display.Amoled is major missing here otherwise phone is very good.Speaker very loud and rich, specially headphone audio quality is very nice if you're a audio lover must buy it.Performance nothing to say Snapdragon nailed it perfectly .Ui very clean Worth buyingREAD MORE",5
Very Good,"Pros - 1. Good performance under high gaming. 2. Good Ram management 3. Decent Camera 4. Good fast charging 4. Sound quality pretty good. Overall a Good phone.Cons - 1. MI interface is the biggest drop, many bloatware and sometimes contact names gets vanished suddenly 2. Sometimes it feels like battery draining faster. 3. Heats up sometimes 4. Call recording is the biggest heart breaking. It screams out call recording started. The other person can easily hear... irritated.READ MORE",4

Wonderful,Everything is perfect. You won't regret at all coz it's performance is above par.Battery management is awesome.Very light weight software but buggy after the Android 11 update. Either don't update or wait for the next software update if you have bought or planning to buy.The UI is buttery smooth and the display though is a LCD but you won't regret at all. Very nicely customised. All apps open in some milliseconds that what I like the most.It has all the latest features and updated hardwa...READ MORE,5

Delightful,"Sd 865 is capable processor but I do see some lags here and there,camera is not that great I don't trust isocell that's why I didn't opted for pro version but sony too is not good in this segment display is IPS thought it's good but you can tell it's not that great cause now a days lower mid range gets amoled display and this one clearly not suitable in this segment,it's a bit bulky and heavy....now comes the battery it's excellent I easily get full day usage I don't need to worry about it dy...READ MORE",4
"Brilliant Display and Camera. Best phone, just go for it!",This Phone is a flagship Killer. In this Price segment getting an 865 Processor (flagship of the year 2020) is great. I was a bit sceptical about the LCD screen but had no issues with it. Xiaomi made sure that it gives the best of its kind and it is way more difficult to mark the difference between AMOLED and LCD screen of mi 10t. The display is buttery smooth and the colours are very groovy. I tested it by playing CPU intensive games for hours but no lag and no heating issue. Just scrolli...READ MORE,5

Not recommended at all,"Please do verify the IMEI number. I received the product where the IMEI number is not valid. If you're IMEI number is not valid the product might be duplicate one, even you will not get better exchange value since the IMEI number won't be matching with Xiomi 10T. Also, if this handset is used for criminal activities tracing will be difficult because the IMEI number registered for this phone is not a valid one.READ MORE",1
