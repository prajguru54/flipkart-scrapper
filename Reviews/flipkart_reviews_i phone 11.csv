The delivery ...,5
Great product,"Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.I’m am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone. I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb. I’ve attached my puppy pics and no fi...",5
Good choice,So far it’s been an AMAZING experience coming back to iOS after nearly a decade but it’s not as versatile as android though phone is sturdy dropped it accidentally a couple of times and nothing happened fortunately camera is awesome,4
Worth every penny,"i11 is worthy to buy, too much happy with the product. Thank u flipkart I received the item on time..loved it..",5
Highly recommended,What a camera .....just awesome ..you can feel this iPhone just awesome . Good for gaming also ...try pubg in hd it’s just wow,5
Highly recommended,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !",5
Perfect product!,It’s a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones. If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it with...,5

Highly recommended,"It's my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation 😍😍 I love the color, I love the assebility of the phone....I need to learn more about its functionality, but as far as I have seen, it's quite easy and it has a lot of functions to work on, specially if you are a content writer or a blogger you get a lot of content creation platforms and they are really amazing. This phone not only for good quality photography but a lot of other task too.😍💯",5
Simply awesome,"Excellent camera, good performance, no lag. The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger .

Worth every penny,"It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome. ...",5
Worth every penny,"Smooth like butter, camera like fantabulous, sound is crystal clear & its red color is damn attractive, i am just loving it. Must buy if you love photography. Lucky to get it in sale, thank you Flipkart.",5
Terrific,Really worth of money. i just love it. It is the best phone ever.,5
Wonderful,This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.,5
Nice product,Awesome Phone. Slightly high price but worth. Better than iPhone XR. Camera is superb and wide angle camera is very clear. 12MP selfie camera is also very good. A13 Chip gives a very good and smooth performance.,4
Perfect product!,"Battery backup is extraordinary, camera is decent & performance offered by A13 bionic is awsome. The display is good in practical usage like the visibility of display is very good in direct sun light compare to pro models. Iam extremely satisfied for the money I spent.",5
Brilliant,"I have migrated from OP 7pro... and trust me, iPhone 11 is totally worth it.. following are the reasons:-1)there is ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH THE DISPLAY... its crisp, sharp and I found it to be much much better than OP7 pro. Netflix, Prime video all run crisply... you won’t miss a thing. True Tone works flawlessly...the display brightness is perfect. OP have not calibrated their screens properly.  2) iPhone 11 series have really good cameras... others have spoken in depth about them.3) bat...",5
Classy product,Superb Product !!! A big and worthy upgrade from mi 3S to iphone 11 . Totally loved it !,5
Must buy!,"It’s an amazing product from apple and the camera is simply superb. Phone is faster.Night shot is simply superb and detailing and colour differentiation from camera is an added advantageThis review I have written from iPhone 11 only and I am glad to say outside.Cons wise if we see HD+ display only, no battery percentage indicator as in older iPhone 8. No assistive touch control button in itNo oleophobic coating on back panel glass and finger prints are visible but since I bought mint gr...",5

Wonderful,"I just directly switch from iphone 6s to iphone 11 .The best premium smartphone I recommend to everyone. Excellent quality and colors the iphone have in 11 series.Camera quality is just awesome and the major feel when we hold in our hands. The sound quality and volume is also higher then the previous models. I will recommend to buy iphone 11 instead of pro models , there is nothing much difference as this model contains everything which fulfill our needs. Only one thing that I dislike abo...",5
Perfect product!,After 1 month use I found camera quality best compared to my previous Samsung note 10+.Display not good as note 10 also charging too slow.Apple should add fast charger like 11 plus and pro.Best phone for daily use,5
Terrific purchase,Upgraded from iphone 6 to 11 best phone for iphone users battery is much better than other iphones camera is awesome love to use it.camera is so clear in night.,5
Simply awesome,It's very high performances devise i am like the service of flipkart delevary very fast and packing very nice perfect phone,5
Great product,"Well you all know the specifications . One of a kind. Best iPhone till date. Many enhancements to the camera app with many options. Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for  than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, musi...",5
Terrific purchase,The built quality is not very premium. The battery back is great .The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .Camera is super duper awesome.The red colour which people think is bright is actually very soothing and excellent colour to choose from .The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor  and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .Camera module is very great and looks very stylish.,5
Mind-blowing purchase,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to shar...",5
Excellent,Amazing camera and feel super machine I am not describe my feeling but this is amazing Phone I am so lucky I have this,5
Simply awesome,Really good actually this is my first apple product am using its really awesome performance wise excellent. Am really happy with this iphone11,5
Good quality product,"it is very good at performance. Camera is best like before and very smooth response even in water. Don’t buy 12 mini buy iPhone 11 , it is far better than 12 mini believe me ! Have a nice day  ☺️",4
Very poor,"Reviewing again after 5 months. At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...",1
Classy product,"We are on apple ecosystem for almost eight years now with couple of iPads and iPhones, including Xr. Bought iPhone 11 as a gift to my daughter who loves it. We chose for a purple coloured one. Believe me it is gorgeous and towards the lighter shade. Dazzling and brilliant!The phone is great and does excellent RAM management like any other Apple device. The screen, though a LCD and lesser ppi as compared to other flagship phones of competitor brands, is a delight to watch with perfect re...",5
Must buy!,"Best Apple iPhone that i have bought at a very reasonable price, camera quality is next level just awesome n of superior quality android phones not even close(RIP) to that and also battery is really  good but packaging by Flipkart of iPhone was very poor of such a expensive product, firstly im bit worried about the quality of product if i purchased it through online how was the product but i think now this was mine best decision to bought it through Flipkart online because i got genuine Apple...",5
Fabulous!,"I can say I'm damn impressed with iPhone 11. As they says iPhone 11 have the toughest glass ever in the smartphone which you'll find on the front and back and it's totally smooth. The fit and finish is full apple quality - there's no sense that any cheaping out has happened in the construction. Without saying it's camera features this review won't complete. The iPhone 11 has a dual camera system, consisting of a wide angle len's that's pretty much same as found on the iPhone XR last year, but...",5

Mind-blowing purchase,First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.    And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days.,5
Wonderful,"Superfast delivery by Flipkart. Thanks.1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad. 3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.4. Performance is one of the best, if not best, in ...",5
Must buy!,"I rate this product 5* as it has got amazing user experience with the best performing A13 bionic processor. The screen responds and graphics rendering is top notch. With casual gaming and internet browsing, the battery lasts for approx. 1 day. Camera is very good. You will fall in love with the portrait mode. You can call me a loyal Apple customer or whatever but I won’t stop praising the products and overall experience. That user experience matters and is worth every penny you pay.Below ar...",5
Great product,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.,5
Very Good,"impressive  super phone and best in class camera ,sound and face unlock is super fast just see and phone is unlock  and fast in daily apps use",4
Classy product,Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black,5
