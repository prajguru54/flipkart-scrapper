Worth every penny,I've purchased just before lock down and thankful to flipkart for delivering it in time. Purchased this phone in offer @Rs. 30.5k and at this price it as a great value for money device. Not opted for 5g variant as in India its too early to purchase a 5G phone. In my opnion till the 5g network will be available all over india  this device will fulfil all my requirements. At that time 5g phones will become cheaper and will be easier to shift to 5g. Using this phone for two months. This is how i...,5

Super!,"Just tried the camera as i like to click a lot of images, clarity that this monster carries is best in the segment with 20X zoom and 48MP sensor. The battery life is great, since i am always on the go its a plus for me, it gives me a backup of at least 1-2 days, not to forget that it only takes 40 Mins to fully charge. Its an absolute delight to use the clean UI which is a refresh from the mundane stock android, coupled with super fast SD 865. I would recommend this to everyone who want to bu...",5
Awesome,"Got a massive discount when I purchased this phone. This monster at this price is a best deal you'll get. Latest Processor - SD 865, super fast UI and amazing battery life with 55W fast charge. And with the monster buttons, playing PUBG got easier even for a noob like me. Have been binge watching Netflix for a couple of days on the 6.4' sAMOLED and the phone hasn‚Äôt heated a bit. Don‚Äôt give it a second thought, just buy it before the offer ends!!",5
Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using this straight for a more than a day and it still has 27% battery left, thanks to the great 4440 mAh battery and 55W fast charge,  I don‚Äôt have to carry a power bank anymore. The UI is seamless and the SD 865 processor makes it super smooth to switch between apps, play PUBG and Asphalt.",5
Just wow!,"Love the camera, the 48MP and 20X zoom works like a charm, great for selfies and portrait shots. Switching to different apps is seamless, thanks to the SD 865 and smooth UI. With all the multitasking, the 4440 mAH battery supports it and just fully charges in 35-40 mins with the 55W fast charging. Definitely a fresh perspective to the smartphone range with the arrival of this monster and i would recommend this to the ones looking to buy the OnePlus 7T .",5

Worst experience ever!,"I have used many brands before. Iqoo UI is the worst I have used so for.Very poor management in settings. Lot of good options are missing. After using Oxygen OS and MIUI, Iqoo feels like I'm 5 years backwards in society.Camera is average.Battery is average but charging is fast.Performance is good so far. I'm not much of a gamer though.My advise is kindly avoid this phone unless they update the UI.",1
Utterly Disappointed,"Buyed this after seeing good reviews, my previous device was OnePlus 6, it's display is far better good than this iqoo's HDR10+ display. While watching 1080p videos in iqoo3 it looks like watching 720p in OnePlus 6. Watching 4k movies in iqoo3 is like watching 1080p in iqoo3. Guys if you used OnePlus phones don't buy this one. Totally regret buying this.",1

Worth every penny,I've purchased just before lock down and thankful to flipkart for delivering it in time. Purchased this phone in offer @Rs. 30.5k and at this price it as a great value for money device. Not opted for 5g variant as in India its too early to purchase a 5G phone. In my opnion till the 5g network will be available all over india  this device will fulfil all my requirements. At that time 5g phones will become cheaper and will be easier to shift to 5g. Using this phone for two months. This is how i...,5

End of the day the battery left was good 60%. Speed is good and the OS is quite rich in features,5

Worst experience ever!,"I have used many brands before. Iqoo UI is the worst I have used so for.Very poor management in settings. Lot of good options are missing. After using Oxygen OS and MIUI, Iqoo feels like I'm 5 years backwards in society.Camera is average.Battery is average but charging is fast.Performance is good so far. I'm not much of a gamer though.My advise is kindly avoid this phone unless they update the UI.",1
Utterly Disappointed,"Buyed this after seeing good reviews, my previous device was OnePlus 6, it's display is far better good than this iqoo's HDR10+ display. While watching 1080p videos in iqoo3 it looks like watching 720p in OnePlus 6. Watching 4k movies in iqoo3 is like watching 1080p in iqoo3. Guys if you used OnePlus phones don't buy this one. Totally regret buying this.",1
Absolute rubbish!,The phone gets heats up on charging. I have to restart my phone twice in a day because it come out of network area to those calling me. Even sms and internet does not work when it comes out of network area. What to do?,1

Worth every penny,I've purchased just before lock down and thankful to flipkart for delivering it in time.

Decent product,Camera average. Good battery life. Display also good due to AMOLED. Phone heats up while charging. Sound ok. Performance good. UI average.

Great product,"Writing this review after using it for more than 30 days. Iqoo 3 is beast, and value for money. Cons:1) Few bugs in Iqoo UI, but they are fixing. Till now I got 3 OTA updates from date of purchase, which is a good thing. 2)Night mode camera  performance is just average, but still need lot of improvement in night mode. Oneplus 7 is giving better night mode shots when compared to Iqoo. (Day light shots are excellent in Iqoo when compared to one plus).",5
Nice product,"I don't know, I feel its good but its too heavy to hold for lomg time, and for pubg or ay other game, as this phone is gaming phone, you have to hold it.

Good,"Ordered this phone as replacement of my MI A1, which has worked so beautifully for almost 3 years. Got 2 major OS update. Lately network became problem and it was not supporting. LTE+ hence data speed was low.Had 3 phones in mind, Redmi k20 pro and this one. K20 was cheaper but is now old and I am sure will not get any OS version upgrade. And couple of them from Samsung.

Worth every penny,I've purchased just before lock down and thankful to flipkart for delivering it in time. Purchased this phone in offer @Rs. 30.5k and at this price it as a great value for money device. Not opted for 5g variant as in India its too early to purchase a 5G phone. In my opnion till the 5g network will be available all over india  this device will fulfil all my requirements. At that time 5g phones will become cheaper and will be easier to shift to 5g. Using this phone for two months. This is how i...,5

Super!,"Just tried the camera as i like to click a lot of images, clarity that this monster carries is best in the segment with 20X zoom and 48MP sensor. The battery life is great, since i am always on the go its a plus for me, it gives me a backup of at least 1-2 days, not to forget that it only takes 40 Mins to fully charge. Its an absolute delight to use the clean UI which is a refresh from the mundane stock android, coupled with super fast SD 865. I would recommend this to everyone who want to bu...",5
Awesome,"Got a massive discount when I purchased this phone. This monster at this price is a best deal you'll get.

Have been binge watching Netflix for a couple of days on the 6.4' sAMOLED and the phone hasn‚Äôt heated a bit. Don‚Äôt give it a second thought, just buy it before the offer ends!!",5
Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using this straight for a more than a day and it still has 27% battery left, thanks to the great 4440 mAh battery and 55W fast charge,  I don‚Äôt have to carry a power bank anymore.

Just wow!,"Love the camera, the 48MP and 20X zoom works like a charm, great for selfies and portrait shots. Switching to different apps is seamless, thanks to the SD 865 and smooth UI. With all the multitasking, the 4440 mAH battery supports it and just fully charges in 35-40 mins with the 55W fast charging. Definitely a fresh perspective to the smartphone range with the arrival of this monster and i would recommend this to the ones looking to buy the OnePlus 7T .",5

Great product,"Writing this review after using it for more than 30 days. Iqoo 3 is beast, and value for money. Cons:1) Few bugs in Iqoo UI, but they are fixing. Till now I got 3 OTA updates from date of purchase, which is a good thing. 2)Night mode camera  performance is just average, but still need lot of improvement in night mode. Oneplus 7 is giving better night mode shots when compared to Iqoo. (Day light shots are excellent in Iqoo when compared to one plus).",5

Worst experience ever!,"I have used many brands before. Iqoo UI is the worst I have used so for.Very poor management in settings. Lot of good options are missing. After using Oxygen OS and MIUI, Iqoo feels like I'm 5 years backwards in society.Camera is average.Battery is average but charging is fast.Performance is good so far. I'm not much of a gamer though.My advise is kindly avoid this phone unless they update the UI.",1
Utterly Disappointed,"Buyed this after seeing good reviews, my previous device was OnePlus 6, it's display is far better good than this iqoo's HDR10+ display. While watching 1080p videos in iqoo3 it looks like watching 720p in OnePlus 6. Watching 4k movies in iqoo3 is like watching 1080p in iqoo3. Guys if you used OnePlus phones don't buy this one. Totally regret buying this.",1

Very poor,over heating mobile in charge,1
Terrific,"Coming from the likes of OnePlus n Samsung I can surely say it's one of the fastest  android smartphone available in the market.SD 865 processor (latest build) , 6.4 sAmoled display, 4440 mah battery with 55w fast charge,monster buttons for PUBG ,the phone has it all. The UI is clean and as close as it gets to a stock android experience and for those who love a  good camera in there hands you are in for a treat with its 48MP primary sensor and 20X zoom.Without a doubt the best in the mark...",5
Worth every penny,I've purchased just before lock down and thankful to flipkart for delivering it in time. Purchased this phone in offer @Rs. 30.5k and at this price it as a great value for money device. Not opted for 5g variant as in India its too early to purchase a 5G phone. In my opnion till the 5g network will be available all over india  this device will fulfil all my requirements. At that time 5g phones will become cheaper and will be easier to shift to 5g. Using this phone for two months. This is how i...,5
Brilliant,Nice mobile Pros:1) Performance beast2)Nice speakers3) Good camera4) Awesome display5) Nice looks 6) headphone jack with headphone included in box7) Excellent battery back up with quick chargeCons:1) 60hz refresh rate2) single speaker,5
Super!,"Just tried the camera as i like to click a lot of images, clarity that this monster carries is best in the segment with 20X zoom and 48MP sensor. The battery life is great, since i am always on the go its a plus for me, it gives me a backup of at least 1-2 days, not to forget that it only takes 40 Mins to fully charge. Its an absolute delight to use the clean UI which is a refresh from the mundane stock android, coupled with super fast SD 865. I would recommend this to everyone who want to bu...",5
Awesome,"Got a massive discount when I purchased this phone. This monster at this price is a best deal you'll get. Latest Processor - SD 865, super fast UI and amazing battery life with 55W fast charge. And with the monster buttons, playing PUBG got easier even for a noob like me. Have been binge watching Netflix for a couple of days on the 6.4' sAMOLED and the phone hasn‚Äôt heated a bit. Don‚Äôt give it a second thought, just buy it before the offer ends!!",5
Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using this straight for a more than a day and it still has 27% battery left, thanks to the great 4440 mAh battery and 55W fast charge,  I don‚Äôt have to carry a power bank anymore. The UI is seamless and the SD 865 processor makes it super smooth to switch between apps, play PUBG and Asphalt.",5
Just wow!,"Love the camera, the 48MP and 20X zoom works like a charm, great for selfies and portrait shots. Switching to different apps is seamless, thanks to the SD 865 and smooth UI. With all the multitasking, the 4440 mAH battery supports it and just fully charges in 35-40 mins with the 55W fast charging. Definitely a fresh perspective to the smartphone range with the arrival of this monster and i would recommend this to the ones looking to buy the OnePlus 7T .",5
Great product,This phone is performance beast and best in this price rangePros:1) Processer is blazzing fast.You can run any game at almost its highest settings2)LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage3)Battery is also good with super fast 55watt charging4)Camera is somewhat near to 64MP with samsung sensors.Doesn't feel like 48 MP(excellent)5)Display is awesome with good colour reproduction6)It comes with 3.5mm jack which is quite good after seeing scenario of other phones like it (earphones included in box...,5
Great product,"After One week of extreme usage I have to say this phone is the beast for gamers and in detailCamera : The images captured from rear camera have more details and well saturated.. The 48mp primary camera helps you take crystal clear images, Ultra wide and macro both does the decent job tooBattery : I thought it would give a pretty decent battery life and that 55W charger I thought it would be good... But it surprised me very much...I play a lot of Pubg in HDR extreme settings and I do get 5...",5

Awesome,"Writing a review after 1 week of using the phone.First of all never apply exchange product on Flipkart, it's just a scam. The delivery boy refused to take my new phone, stating it has cracks and it was on tempered glass which I removed and showed also and it was completely new.The Silver color is much amazing than the black one.The camera is also good but the front camera is not that great.The performance of the phone is just a beast.Playing Pubg on hd with extreme graphics with no ...",5

Simply awesome,"Superb phone if you are pubg lover then definitely go for it, in lobby of game your game load first. Take very few sec to start graphic really awesome. Camera is too good even in low light image stabilization was amazing factor in camera. Snapdragon 865 is give God performance. If you open some tab now and next day if you open again, it will directly open same tab in same condition where you left. In one word I will say it's a performance beast.

Highly recommended,"Writing this review after 2 weeks of extensive use, was using OnePlus 3T before and it was high time to switch to new phone, was in a dilema to shift to oneplus 7T or 8 but did detail review and after research n comparision bought this phone.Really happy with the performance till now. 5star in all the aspects, I am not a gamer but do lot of office work and browsing..it's really fast and camera is also good so for now happy with this phone.",5
Excellent,"RecommendedFast processor and memory access, ample storage space (at least for me who recently upgraded from scanty 16 GB to 128 GB), decent display, super responsive touch gestures, useful battery capacity, satisfying camera (at this price), effective split screen app function...A bit heavier side, bluetooth connectivity for some wireless headphones can be a bit inconsistent intermittently, dark theme is too blackish with no contrasting virtual buttons/notifications, ""work"" profile shou...",5
Decent product,Camera average. Good battery life. Display also good due to AMOLED. Phone heats up while charging. Sound ok. Performance good. UI average. Bit heavy and back of the phone is fingerprint magnet. Better to use a case supplied in the box. Overall decent phone for hardcore gamers not for normal use.,3
Perfect product!,This Phone is Osm. Its camera is pretty good. Its battery life is also good & it charges too fast and yes Most important processor is too good.Over all the phone does its job very well. Go for it!,5
Great product,"Writing this review after using it for more than 30 days. Iqoo 3 is beast, and value for money. Cons:1) Few bugs in Iqoo UI, but they are fixing. Till now I got 3 OTA updates from date of purchase, which is a good thing. 2)Night mode camera  performance is just average, but still need lot of improvement in night mode. Oneplus 7 is giving better night mode shots when compared to Iqoo. (Day light shots are excellent in Iqoo when compared to one plus).",5
Nice product,"I don't know, I feel its good but its too heavy to hold for lomg time, and for pubg or ay other game, as this phone is gaming phone, you have to hold it. ROG might be a heavier, so i don't know if it is the best or second best to ROG for gaming.PS: Triggers works fine, sometimes I feel some misses but who knows",4
Mind-blowing purchase,"got my Device the next day, itself kudos to FK for fast delivery. was supere excited to used  this due to all hype and I must say it has supered my expectation. super fast processor ( best in class SD865 ) grate battery life with 55W fast charger and dedicated monster buttons for people 2ho like to play PUBG, Asphalt.

Terrific purchase,Gave me a scare when the phone did not boot up. Nothing happened even after charging the phone for few minutes. Luckily started after 5 mins.Phone is a super fast and battery backup is good. The phone charged to 80% in 45 mins. The phone was on for next 6 hours continuously as set up the phone. End of the day the battery left was good 60%. Speed is good and the OS is quite rich in features,5
