Worth every penny,"I'm writing this review after 2 month's of use. I'll get straight to the point with the battery. The other features are truly upto the mark.

Check the images for battery backup.",5

Good choice,Camera is good... Could be better. Display is bright enough for use outdoors... Battery is good for a day.... Takes 45 mins to charge with included 65w SuperDart charger.. Whereas it is claimed 0-100% in 35 mins... Really disappointed... NFC is useful for contactless  payments..Proper price would be around 25 k instead of 30k....Memory card slot is missing...

Good quality product,The 120hz Amoled display is the best highlight of this phone along with its processor.The only con I found was the battery life.In daily usage it's giving me at most 4 hrs of screen on time and due to this I can't fully enjoy my experience using it as I have to plug it in every 12hrsThe charger provided is 65 Watts and the charging is pretty fast (20-100%) in less than 40 minutes and to some point it copes up for the fact that the battery optimization is really poor.Taking all into consid...,4
Worth the money,"Camera Needs little improvements in HDR and Night Shots. Dual Speakers are üî• fire, Loud and Clear Sound, fantastic job.

The super AMOLED display gives punchy colour and great viewing angles. The quality of the AMOLED display is very good. With 120 Hz refresh rate it is a treat.2. The battery life of the device is also good. Typically it will definately last an average person for a full day. Combined with the 65 W Super Dart charger I would say that the battery is great. The charger supplie...,4
Good quality product,The phone is good overall using it since 3daysI don't think No SD card slot or 3.5mm jack are cons as they are compromised in most phones in this prise segmentThe only con I found is heating it easily gets heated(warm) even for yt but heavy games are running smooth without overheating (thx to cooling system)The screen is absolutely gorgeousThe OS is also good and light could be better hoping for good updates in future Gaming is excellent with 1000+ dimensity chipset and 120hz refresh rat...,4
Value-for-money,"Got this phone delivered within two days of ordering it in Flipkart. Delivery was on time. Let me give a quick review of the phone. Phone is a class product. Looks classy and surely it is in the flagship category. Display is excellent, battery life is really good. Lasted for more than a day after using it for calling, browsing, video calls and bit of gaming. So battery life is something that is a plus and the quick charger does it's duty well. Camera seems to  good at all angles and times of...",4
Decent product,I like the phone and it's fantasy color for sure but the big branding of dare to leap is ruining the awesome color the phone has. There is one issue which is heating. The phone gets heated pretty easily. I used the camera for about 10 mins after switching it on for the first time and the heat was recognisable. The phone is fast for sure cause it can capture 64mp photos fast. There is no 4k video mode for front and wide angle cameras. The battery is good but the optimisation could have been be...,3
Good,"I want to start my review by saying it's an overpriced phone, display is pretty good but as it is running on realme UI 1.0, it's dark theme is like grey instead of black..face lots of problem under direct sunlight bcoz grey theme becomes more greyish..secondly camera is worst, even last year's budget segment phones can beat it in camera department..Battery is good even using with 120hz display, charging is blazing fast..UI is good but still running on UI 1.0 Even though as per Realme,it is a...",3

Simply awesome,"Mobile is really good... Highly recommended for buy this phone... Fantasy colour is awesome but I don't like the big branding""Dare to leap""... Gaming performance is very good and no heating issue... Awesome camera and the AI filter are really good... And the main advantage is the super amoled display with 120hz and the 35min full charge... Almost 35mins to 39mins required for full charge... Go for it...",5
Value-for-money,"Very nice product ,nice display,best performance, better back camera but the front camera is not very good as it's price!!!Overall best phn under this budget",4
Simply awesome,The product is really superb in its price catagory. Screen resolution is really good. The sound out out from dual speaker could have been better. Camera performance in low light is awesome. I have not checked with gaming performance. But day to day usage is good. I liked the fast charging mostly. It's charges 100% by the time you take bath.,5

Wonderful,"My family is part of realme family from the first mobile realme 1 and thay always give satisfactory result,so thank you realme and thank you x7 pro for give this type of offer to purchase such great product",5
Awesome,"Battery charging speed is amazing almost 3% per minute, But Only 4.5 GB free RAM available without installing any new app, notification and ringtone volume control is common. Overall this phone is a good choice.",5
Highly recommended,"Best smartphone I have ever used.Saying it overpriced is not fair because some features are not mentioned which are just awesome (specially the tactile engine that produces 3D vibration). Camera quality is great, no doubt.Don't get confused, if your budget is under 30k then go for it and if you have credit card then it's the best you can have.",5
Worth every penny,"I'm writing this review after 2 month's of use. I'll get straight to the point with the battery. The other features are truly upto the mark. One thing about camera, it's not the best one at this price. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's great but there are phones in the market at this price with better camera quality. Check the images for battery backup.",5
Excellent,Everything Is Good But For Battery Performance In This Prize Range You Go With Other Opt. But The +Point Is 36min Full Charge.I Love Night Feature.,5
Good choice,Camera is good... Could be better. Display is bright enough for use outdoors... Battery is good for a day.... Takes 45 mins to charge with included 65w SuperDart charger.. Whereas it is claimed 0-100% in 35 mins... Really disappointed... NFC is useful for contactless  payments..Proper price would be around 25 k instead of 30k....Memory card slot is missing... Realme should have given 8Gb/256Gb variant in India like in China...,4
Awesome !!!!!!!!,This phone is a beast when comes to perfomance Pros1) 120hz display gives you butter smooth display experience.2) no lag or any sort of problem Dimensity 1000+ is amazing great perfomance3) good gaming experience 4) charging is awesome 38min full charged.5) most of the things works just smoothlyCons Camera is average or just above average lets just say its satisfactory battery is pretty average too but 30 min full charge covers up for iti dont see any much complicated problems go...,4
Highly recommended,"This phone is all I wanted within a budget of 30k. Really fast and smooth and charges to 100% within 40-42 minutes max.The inhand feel of the phone is really good. You actually feel like you are holding a premium device.Games run smoothly, BGMI gives option of smooth+ extreme graphics and ultra framerate with higher graphics settings. CODM runs at high graphics settings at 60fps too.Phone has not heated up so far for me even when gaming.The only concern I have so far is that battery dra...",5
Good quality product,The 120hz Amoled display is the best highlight of this phone along with its processor.The only con I found was the battery life.In daily usage it's giving me at most 4 hrs of screen on time and due to this I can't fully enjoy my experience using it as I have to plug it in every 12hrsThe charger provided is 65 Watts and the charging is pretty fast (20-100%) in less than 40 minutes and to some point it copes up for the fact that the battery optimization is really poor.Taking all into consid...,4
Worth the money,"Camera Needs little improvements in HDR and Night Shots. Dual Speakers are üî• fire, Loud and Clear Sound, fantastic job. Charging speed is OMGüò± in Just 40 minutes from zero to 100. 1000+ is really a powerful processor i must say, played Call of Duty for half an hour and no frame drops in Highest game settings.

Brilliant,"Camera quality should have been better don't know inspite of Sony sensor camera quality is not good... May be better software optimization will help. Battery lasting is one day full use...  Display is wonderful, crisp. Processor performance is good no lag. Charging is insanely fast. Fantasy colour is wonderful but big branding Dare to leap writing in the back is annoying. Will update later.",5
Simply awesome,"It's indeed a very beautiful device in this price range. That super Amoled display coupled with 120Hz refresh rate makes it the best in class. Stereo speakers are very load & good in quality. Battery is not poor but yes due to that screen it consumes more, but it can still last throughout a day. But nothing to worry as the 65watt charger will make you say Wow! Camera I will say, its good but not the best in this range, and can still provide you good images. Though lots of camera features ar...",5
Terrific,"Best of best after complete one day use, pubg at HDR-High is very smooth and fast charging compensates the fast draining battery.240Hz touch sampling is very smooth while accessing any apps or scrolling through them. Atleast 3+ years usable phone.",5

Delightful,"Feels like a premium phone. Display with 120Hz is amazing. Colours are vivid and it's fun to watch videos. Battery backup is good...lasts almost a day but with fast charging, won't take more than 40 mins to juice up.No complaints when it comes to performance too. Only played Pubg but runs smoothly with very little heat being emitted. Can open multiple apps, no lag, no complaints.Camera is the only complaint. Not that bright, pictures not that great. Overall a good buy.",4
Highly recommended,Great mobile.....But once ordered please Go to phone management app and test the whole phone because in some devices some sensors not working....but the whole phone is awesome after the replacement and hope it will get more more amazing after the realmeui2.0 update after April...,5
Super!,"The night mode in the camera is not so great, the device is fast and is very good for basic usage, If you want more customisation, choose a different brand all together, the wide angle camera is great. The vibration of the phone is just like a basic phone as well.The selfie is not that great either",5
Must buy!,"Excellent build quality & design, awesome camera set up besides 2-2 MP cameras, mediateck helio dimensity 1000+ nice processor, 4500 mha good battery & 65 watt super dart charger , 120 Hz refresh rate, 240 touch sampling rate, overall budget flagship smartphone in this price segment.
