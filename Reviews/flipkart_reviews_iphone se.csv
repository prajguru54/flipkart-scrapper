Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.,4
Iphone SE Budgeted Phone of 2020?,"I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows* Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.              2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.              3) Touch sensor works very precisely              4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry           ...",3

Love at First Home Touch,"Totally worth the price if:- you are a iOS fan- like compact phone- want to switch from android to iPhone- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (yo...",4
Worth the money,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating,4
Brilliant,"People talk about it‚Äôs battery backup?? man I‚Äôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you‚Äôve used both you‚Äôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I‚Äôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.",5
Very Good,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it‚Äôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it‚Äôs battery. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.",4
Wonderful,"Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours.

Value-for-money,"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest.",4
Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...",4

Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.

Brilliant,For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean  top notch performance ......FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch . Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing.

Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it. Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn‚Äôt matter so much. Display is ok.

Highly recommended,I had been eagerly waiting for iPhone SE 2 ever since its news and articles started floating around techsites around a year back.

Very Good,"Great performance....!!!!!As expected from the A13 Bionic. Battery life can be avg or good depending on personal use . Have to charge the phone at least twice a day . Best Single camera setup . It is a compact phone , not quite great for video content. Great buy for 31k .",4
Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace.

Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly.I use social media apps l...,5
Awesome,"I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm. The highlight of this product is it‚Äôs elegance and sleek design. Looks so good in white colour. Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU. If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it. But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed, CAMERA, looks, iOS ecosystem and longevity of this devic...",5
Good phone for the price,"Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:Pros:1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.2. Very good single camera for daylight photography. Night time is good but not great.3. Optimal screen size for a phone for one hand use.4. Brilliant looks5. Battery life is one day when used like a phone. Watch various youtube videos to increase battery life. Optimal use of battery saver mode and screen brightness can...",5
Highly recommended,"iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof..Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it.It is good for email surfing, browsing, couple of videos per day.Camera quality is not superb but good in day lightVideo is extraordinary i can sayPerformance speed is tremendousBattery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands.White color stand unique in crowd.. because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets..Can go...",5
Super!,"My first iPhone and very happy with it. Slick and gorgeous design with perfect compact mobile. Performance is so amazing ,display softness more than 5 *. Little bit battery issues for fast drains like need to charge once in a 12 hours. May be this will solve out in next update. Definitely worth to buy than other brands.",5
Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it. Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn‚Äôt matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one a...",4
Highly recommended,I had been eagerly waiting for iPhone SE 2 ever since its news and articles started floating around techsites around a year back. I was using the iPhone SE (previous gen) back then and it worked brilliantly for two years before its Battery health went below 80%.An android user will never understand why an iPhone user sticks to their ecosystem despite them being expensive. Pros of iPhone SE 20201. A13 bionic chip - makes the phone a beast2. Camera - has portrait mode. Does the job brilli...,5
Value-for-money,This is the first iPhone I hv bought .. It‚Äôs bit diff for me using this first first as for so many years I hv been using android.. but I am actually liking it .. The camera omg it‚Äôs really awesome .. like it feels classy using this .. Battery is also as of now good enough .. I am writing this review after using it for 40 days.. if anyone is thinking of buying this pls go for it .. Thanks.,4
Very Good,"Great performance....!!!!!As expected from the A13 Bionic. Battery life can be avg or good depending on personal use . Have to charge the phone at least twice a day . Best Single camera setup . It is a compact phone , not quite great for video content. Great buy for 31k .",4
Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace. The only small minus point is battery. A but as i am a moderate user its perfectly fine for me. Great product as usual from apple.üôåüèª,5
Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger.",5
Value-for-money,"USP:1. Compact mobile which i always wanted in iPhone models2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.3. Camera is awesome to take pics (only day time) 4K videos 30/60 fps.Downside:1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.Note: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.This is for someone who w...",4
Must buy!,"Very nice phone. Actually it's my first iPhone so I was very excited. Nd I'm happy with this phone.Nice phone for gaming, battery backup is not that much for gaming but I suggest buy one good powerbank or fast charger. If u have small fingers then it's best device for u.",5
Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.P.S.- it's not that small.",5

Wonderful,Buying the same phone for the second time. Perfomance and camera are off the charts. No other mid range has these. But the battery life is extremely low. I bought an se 1 year ago. Being a hardcore user the battery health dropped to 80% so that i needed to charge 4 times a day. Buying a power bank can solve the battery issue.,5
Awesome,Undoubtedly premium phone.,5
Does the job,"Everything is good and smooth operating display.. Camera is excellent.. But, only problem is Battery.. Battery backup is not good.. Normal call use its ok.. But for watching video, playing games etc., Battery not upto the mark.. U can use this phone as a secondary phone not for primary phone.. Think Twice before buy.",3

Awesome,Bought and used this device for 24 hours. This is pretty good bargain for People who do phone calls and watch few videos. Battery holds good for a day if you don‚Äôt push it. Don‚Äôt fall for the battery drain and charge testing videos. Use a Samsung charger. It charges fast while not heating the phone.Camera is awesome and you don‚Äôt have to be a pro to click some brilliant pictures and videos. You want an iPhone then go for it.,5
