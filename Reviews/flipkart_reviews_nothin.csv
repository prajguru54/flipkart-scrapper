A moment.,"ANC is not par with Airpods Pro but it is decent for its price. Can filter out all white noises like fan, ac, rain etc. Struggles with people talking. Can be considered a positive if you are in busy environment where you want to be heard when people call you. It can only store one Bluetooth pairing at a time, means you always have to create a new pairing with the next device. There is issues with ear detection, it may pause when taken out of ear but continues playing even when its not back ...",5
Classy product,Went over my expectations. The features are great. Good that NOTHING gave a software update already and hoping for more in case any bugs come up. Bugs are welcome as the company and product are absolutely new in market. Design is sleek and new. Can't really tell if battery is good as of now. But it seems to be 3.5-4/5 for now.,5
Fabulous!,Awesome tws earbuds at the price !!ANC & ENC is also right at the point. Also these pair is very comfy and punchy bass. Just go for it <3,5

Wonderful,"I can see, lot of effort has been put make this piece of gem. The connectivity and battery backup are very good. Sound quality is way better than what I did expect.But bit disappointed with comfort when I wear earbuds, may be I had over expectation ;) Any way.. it's a successful first step to make the user feel ""there is nothing in the ear (no earbuds!) when we use it"". I am excited to see what more you offer in the next model of Nothing earbuds.",5
Worth every penny,"I researched a lot of TWS ranging from 1k to 10k. This is the best deal I found in terms of money and quality. Surely it is one of the best TWS available in the market. ANC is okay but I didn't like the ANC feature as it will appear like your ears are blocked and soon can create a headache. So if you are someone who likes to be light on ears, then please don't look for ANC, you will anyway have to keep it turned OFF.1) Sound quality is great but not as great as KZN pro (ofcourse single driv...",5
Simply awesome,"Excellent product from Nothing.. Worth for the price, worth the hype. Good packaging. And the sound quality is good.. If you are expecting some high-end experience for sound quality or ANC then this is not the product for you.. But for 6k, you get all the basic needs that is needed for a TWS such as design, build quality, battery life, decent ANC, good sound quality. Hope this helps..!",5
Perfect product!,"I believe that a typical listener, who has tested very few earphones in their life, will be impressed and most likely like these. The sound, functionality, etc. should please you. There is no reason to expect these budget earphones to perform as well as top dogs in the field, but they stand above the rest in their price range - MY OPINIONSound : They are very BASS focused, with crisp notes and the bass is wicked.

Great product,I'm not joking but I liked the sound of my wired jbl earphones that were of 650bucks. And this gives much better sound so complaints on that. I know some people are really keen on the sound quality but u have to consider that this is a tws at a price much lower than the airpods or sonys. And considering that I think this gives a pretty much all round performance. I'm in love with the design.

Fabulous!,"Oh my god! I can not suggest any other TWS under 10k! Elite features and seamless performance ensures mind boggling music experience. I observed right ear bud disconnects after long and continuous usage, but its a software blip which might be rectified in further updates. But believe me, if you are a beginner and doesn't want any risk to be taken while buying, simply press the orange button on ( buy now). Beast!",5

Don’t trust all review of the product on YouTube and its a beast in this price range and wish future products by Nothing will put other run for their money 😉 Luckily I’m the first reviewer of the product over here 😂,5
Brilliant,"These sound unreal.Bought them with my first salary, Worth every penny. You won't regret buying these, Loved it❣️",5
Awesome,The product is amazing. The build quality is perfect.The base is good...You can customize it though the app.The only con is:After continuous usage you can find scratches with the charging box as it is transparent..You can use skins or cases to avoid that,5
Super!,"These are beautiful. I had airpods pro before switching to android gave these a try and these are way more comfortable. Tried them at the gym 10/10 tried them in an aircraft 10/10. Don't think of negative reviews. This product is excellent design wise, sound wise, and cost wise... Cheers!",5
Just wow!,I Got today Till Now It Is good.,5
Fabulous!,"Oh my god! I can not suggest any other TWS under 10k! Elite features and seamless performance ensures mind boggling music experience. I observed right ear bud disconnects after long and continuous usage, but its a software blip which might be rectified in further updates. But believe me, if you are a beginner and doesn't want any risk to be taken while buying, simply press the orange button on ( buy now). Beast!",5
Don't waste your money,"I got these headphones hoping for a revolutionary product like oneplus.I was sadly disappointed... The product out of the box worked fine (after 3 returns of defective products ) and I was ok with it... After just one week of usage I found the battery is draining super fast.

Utterly Disappointed,"Okay.

Waste of money!,"You will find a lot of pros in other reviews, just read it. But I am here to talk about the things I didn't like very much about this product.1. First and foremost, the battery back up. It is safe to say it does not the perform as specified. You cannot go 24 hrs with ANC on (while using case- just in case anyone is confused). Maximum I could stretch was 18-20 hrs. Bear in mind I am not a tech reviewer just an ordinary guy who used it throughout the day.2. ANC is decent but there much left t...",1
Useless product,The product has so many bugs. It keeps disconnecting multiple time and some times one of the buds just gets disconnected randomly. Also music stops randomly for few seconds. Dont waste your money on this product. The firmware update in the software didn't solve the disconnection issue. Don't fall for the hype around this product. It looks cool but not upto the mark in terms of software and connection maintainance standards. You can get other TWS for lesser price instead of spending 6k for a b...,1
"Cheap Product, most users received defective piece.","Right ear bud not working and the case not charging, I guess most of the users are facing the same issue (of right ear bud not working) hence returned the product.",1
Horrible,When I got my wireless earphones the right earpiece was charged at 40 percent and the left at 80 percent. I charged the case and the earphones to 100 percent. After using it for a while the battery of right earpiece decreased to 40 percent and the left earpiece to 80 percent. Touch controls are really bad and the proximity sensor does not work properly. If the stem of the earpiece is not at a certain distance from your face it will spaz out and pause the video whenever it wants. Maybe my ear ...,1
Hated it!,"After a single charge, The earbuds stopped workingNow the case light indicator is also not working. If anyone knows the solution.. please let me know",1
Defective Product,"Received a defective product. Right earbud doesn't charge with the case, and battery for right earbud gets depleted within 1 hour. Flipkart has accepted the replacement will update if the replacement works properly.",1
Worthless,DON'T BUY these...  they are become pathetic for me..  ANC not working properly.. On/Off automatically while watching a movie /videos on mobile..  The main issue is songs automatically play /pause again n again.. such a worst earphone....  DON'T BUY DON'T BUY,1
Horrible,"Sound quality is good no doubt in that but rest of things aren't worth it. App is buggy, earphone gets disconnected by itself. The charging box is too fragile and catches scratches very easily.",1
Terrible product,"Received faulty earbuds from flipkart, the right ear buds charge finishes within 30 mins. Emailed the company but they said can’t help as you bought from 3rd party (flipkart).Very bad experience, only able to use left ear buds properly.",1
Hated it!,"Defective , right earpod not working",1
Utterly Disappointed,"Okay, so let me break down, why I have given it a 1 star.Number 1 - when I first received the product, I couldn't make it to work with my daily phone or with my backup phone. I got really worried and I tried to connect the headsets with another 3/4 devices, including 2 laptops but It was not connecting to any of them.

Terrible product,The right earpod stopped working after a month,1
Useless product,"Within a month of usage, right ear bud started running out of battery within an hour of use while the left one only reaches 90% battery level.",1
Horrible,"I dont quite like this one.Normally I dont keep charging case with me always, I carry only earbuds with me. But this earbuds cant be turned on without charging case which is so annoying, because charging is really bigBesides these earbuds stays on standby for only 5-10 minutes and then it turns off And wear detection dont work most of the times.",1
Not recommended at all,It gives me connectivity issues. And keeps making strange noises in between. Not as smooth as i had imagined it to be. Sound is good. Noise cancellation is decent. But sometimes only one side connects and i have to put it in the case to re connect. Some times it disconnects from my laptop and most of the times it keeps making a beep at random. Not happy. The hype was all fake,1
Terrible product,My Right ear piece stopped charging just after 2 months of usage,1
Horrible,Worst headset,1
Unsatisfactory,Received a fault pair. One of the buds is getting drained within 29 minutes.,1
Utterly Disappointed,"It definetly was a horrible experience buying nothing from 5999It disconnects everytime u move your head, u touch ur ear, so dont waste ur money on it.",1
Don't waste your money,"Worst battery back up won't even stay for 2 hrs, better to for another product like boat or any other's in the market with a better back up",1
Terrible product,Battery drain issue plz don’t buy this product,1
Utterly Disappointed,right side earphone does not connect.,1
Absolute rubbish!,Waste product...left earpiece has stopped working within one week and when checked with Flipkart it comes under no return policy it seems.,1
Did not meet expectations,Only 1 of my earphones is working.I tried connecting to my PC and other mobiles but still only the left earpiece was working.,1
Not recommended at all,Best ear phones with active noise cancellation you can buy at this price point. Go for them,1
Worst experience ever!,"Worst product,please take my earbud return .its trouble with connectivity in iphone 12 pro.please do needful",1
Don't waste your money,Right earbud failed in just 10 days.. No service centre as of now.. Product will easily take scratches and you cant even apply for return. I cared it like a baby but still it will take scratches..,1
Waste of money!,Don't waste your money on this product. Go wid Samsung buds or Google buds. No hi siri or ok google support,1
Useless product,I just unboxed my earphones and the left one has a warbling sound when I switch on noise cancellation. This is so disappointing. The first time I decided to invest in expensive earphones and this happens.,1
Waste of money!,call quality is to bad. the person on the other side cannot hear me clearly,1
Absolute rubbish!,"It's very buggy, 1. it constantly disconnects from the phone2. Very bad battery life3. Bass is mediocre4. Sound quality is same as a 500 rs earphonesDesign and build quality is good but what's the point if it constantly keeps disconnecting. The product experience of using it is very bad. And switching devices is a nightmare.",1
Don't waste your money,The touch controls don't work at all and even the noise cancellation and transparency mode stopped working within an hour of use. Absolute worst experience.,1
Worst experience ever!,"Initially the headset was doing okay. After some update, it don’t work properly, lots of disturbances, no clarity in voice, breaking issues",1
Worthless,waste of money i tell go with realmi buds air 2,1
Waste of money!,Worst sound quality and battery backup. Don't even think about the ANC in it. It just works for namesake. I recommend not to buy. Just overhyped piece of TECH.,1
Utterly Disappointed,Buds have lots of bugs 🤣 stay away.1. Hissy noise. 2. Noice Cancellation get on on off during call making the call experience worst. 3. Battery for both the buds gets discharged seperately4. Sound quality isn't constant.,1
Very poor,2 :30 hours battery Low Kwality bakwas money waste😔😭😭😭😭😭😭,1
Hated it!,It has become dysfunctional within 4 months.,1

Unsatisfactory,Having battery issue,1
Worthless,Calling problem and mic issue..not good sencer..many complain in vivo phon ..I m chang 3 different vivo phon same mic and sencer issue.,1
Not recommended at all,Only one bud connects automatically i need to place the other bud in case and on/off to connect everytime Resetting doesn’t helped.,1

Super!,"Expect it to perform like a 6k earbuds and you will not be disappointed.Do not compare it with any earbuds above 10k.*Updated review after usage, Increased 1 Star since we got an update to use low latency mode which is very useful while gaming and audio video sync*What I liked---Good design, looks even better in person.-Build quality is good-Pristine bass.-Mid and Low tones are well balanced.-Call quality is above average.-Features are amazing.-Buds have low battery backup but th...",5
Fabulous!,"Excellent product, I didn't hope for this good. The product is amazing and the sound signature is also good, but there will be disappointment for bass lovers as the bass isn't that punchy but it is fine pumps in whenever you want.Better use the earpods with anc for better sound and I suggest to switch to more bass on app.Regarding app and software, app is clean as paper loved it .There are few bugs too, like disconnecting and right earplug disconnecting and in ear detection and not eq pres...",5

(Airpods pro level amazing at this price)#3) Very comfortable in ear and weightless!#4) Gestures are awsm!#5) ANC - Satisfiable #6) Battery - Tbh, not amazing but OK!CONS : Being a new product from a new brand, you might encounter a few bugs.- Stopped working, contacted customer care, they arranged for a pickup so after-sales service is good as well.",5
Just wow!,"Overall a great value for money purchase which is one of the best in this price segment. Detailed review: Comfort - this is one of the biggest plus points, incredible comfort, it nestles beautifully in your ear without you even feeling it's there. Usability and connectivity - pairs and connects seamlessly and the auto detect when taken out of the ear works perfectly wellTouch controls : work very easily and very easy to get used toANC - adequate but not the most powerful. Can elimin...",5
A moment.,"ANC is not par with Airpods Pro but it is decent for its price. Can filter out all white noises like fan, ac, rain etc. Struggles with people talking. Can be considered a positive if you are in busy environment where you want to be heard when people call you. It can only store one Bluetooth pairing at a time, means you always have to create a new pairing with the next device. There is issues with ear detection, it may pause when taken out of ear but continues playing even when its not back ...",5
Classy product,Went over my expectations. The features are great. Good that NOTHING gave a software update already and hoping for more in case any bugs come up. Bugs are welcome as the company and product are absolutely new in market. Design is sleek and new. Can't really tell if battery is good as of now. But it seems to be 3.5-4/5 for now.,5
Fabulous!,Awesome tws earbuds at the price !!ANC & ENC is also right at the point. Also these pair is very comfy and punchy bass. Just go for it <3,5
Terrific purchase,"Best earbuds you can get, stylish design and well build and sound that sounds premium. Pros: 1.

Highly recommended,These are the osm ear buds at this price range ANC is good sound quality is good battery backup osm Overall satisfied and best ear buds at this price range Must buy ☺️,5
Wonderful,"I can see, lot of effort has been put make this piece of gem. The connectivity and battery backup are very good. Sound quality is way better than what I did expect.But bit disappointed with comfort when I wear earbuds, may be I had over expectation ;) Any way.. it's a successful first step to make the user feel ""there is nothing in the ear (no earbuds!) when we use it"". I am excited to see what more you offer in the next model of Nothing earbuds.",5
Worth every penny,"I researched a lot of TWS ranging from 1k to 10k. This is the best deal I found in terms of money and quality. Surely it is one of the best TWS available in the market. ANC is okay but I didn't like the ANC feature as it will appear like your ears are blocked and soon can create a headache. So if you are someone who likes to be light on ears, then please don't look for ANC, you will anyway have to keep it turned OFF.1) Sound quality is great but not as great as KZN pro (ofcourse single driv...",5
Simply awesome,"Excellent product from Nothing.. Worth for the price, worth the hype. Good packaging. And the sound quality is good.. If you are expecting some high-end experience for sound quality or ANC then this is not the product for you.. But for 6k, you get all the basic needs that is needed for a TWS such as design, build quality, battery life, decent ANC, good sound quality. Hope this helps..!",5
Perfect product!,"I believe that a typical listener, who has tested very few earphones in their life, will be impressed and most likely like these. The sound, functionality, etc. should please you. There is no reason to expect these budget earphones to perform as well as top dogs in the field, but they stand above the rest in their price range - MY OPINIONSound : They are very BASS focused, with crisp notes and the bass is wicked. Oh yeah, and they are extremely loud, like real loud. Big shout out to the lad...",5
Wonderful,"Technical first:Honest and mid range budget customer experience:As most of them are saying the sound is really crisp and rich.Bass is heavy if you put On ANC plus the 'More Bass' EQ from the app.Balanced EQ (default) is crisp and OK for most of the users.For me I like 'more bass' and 'voice' for podcasts.I was lucky enough that I didn't get any bugs while pairing or using it in the first week,Since I got two updates in one week, meaning that they are listening to the community.Everythin...",5
Terrific purchase,"Value for money .I will recommend if you are looking for best TWS ,  better sound quality & ANC in this price range.",5
Must buy!,"Previously I was using OnePlus buds Z, which are optimised for bass. So In got use to the level of bass. When heard Nothing ear 1, I was not happy with the level of bass which I had earlier heard. But I decided to let me burn first, my God they came out as even better the thumpness, low bass(20-50hz) is extremely heavy.1- Bass is lit !2- The mid are good !3- Highs could have been better, but you wont feel it if you haven't heard something of studio quality.4- Battery back-up(buds) is aro...",5
Mind-blowing purchase,Why some people say just this product sounds good... This product sounds  excellent.. i also used airpods pro... I think this is better than airpods pro.. this nothing has got everything in balanced highs mids lows... Aipods are a bit trebelish ... Everyone think apple products are perfect.. but nothing is perfect... ANC  is okaish.. for the price in mind ... This is way too ahead,5
Just wow!,"I would give them a 4.5 if they had the option, but because these are incredible, especially for the price point, I have rounded up.The highs:1. The sound quality is top notch and rivals the AirPods Pro. 2. The case and the buds look gorgeous.3. In ear feel is absolutely fantastic! The mids:1. The sound from the microphone is crisp, with no complaints from callers. 2. Transparency mode works fairly well.3. Battery is average. Lasted me 3.5-4 hours with transparency on while toggling...",5
Terrific purchase,Received mine today at namma mysuru Karnataka. very fast delivery by flipkart. Product quality is good. sounds fine. balanced sound. for 5999 its value for money. All gestures works fine. With ANC On it sounds best. voice calls are good.,5
Great product,I'm not joking but I liked the sound of my wired jbl earphones that were of 650bucks. And this gives much better sound so complaints on that. I know some people are really keen on the sound quality but u have to consider that this is a tws at a price much lower than the airpods or sonys. And considering that I think this gives a pretty much all round performance. I'm in love with the design. Just hope that they last longer coz I am a stringy person and this is the most i have ever spent on a ...,5
Fabulous!,Mind blowing sound for this price range.. Works very well with my mi 11 ultra.. Once again Carl pie proved his best with this device.. Go for it blindly.,5
Great product,"Delighted after arrival, but the touch is a bit too sensitive for my taste as anc turns off even with non capacitive touches of things such as pillows hence switched one tap hold off, sound quality simply put is balanced and immersive to all ears no bass heaviness present and mids sound quite beautiful for the price. But special mention to the level of anc at this price is priceless and also the weight is not too light that you forget you have something in your ears while opening a tshirt and...",5
Brilliant,"Got this for 4k only.Definitely worth 4k and definitely not worth 7k.😂😂Sound quality is good.Very very comfortable.Bass is not overpowered, which is good.Vocals could have been better.Sounds better than oneplus buds z. But but but the call quality is worst.",5
Worth every penny,Sound quality is this  price is really amazing just loved them design really great fits in ear really comfortably noise cancellation is also really good worth the money.,5
Mind-blowing purchase,OMG This is the best earphone there is .I mean earphone better than this one is ipods pro which are like 20k.This one is like quater the price and it delivers.very satisfied wth the product.,5
Must buy!,First the design is unique.The system is different compair to othe ear buds.The clarity of sound system is awesome.Sensor of this nothing ear 1 is very smooth to useAnd the buds are really weightless and very smooth,5
Terrific,"Looks - This is one of its kind. Transparent and circuit visible .Sound - Sound is very decent though you won’t get much Bass in it but yes sound is crystal and clear. You can also select some sound options in the Nothing Ear (1) app.Call quality - This is the main reason why I wanted a Better Ear phones and believe me this is the best in this range. Even while riding a bike if you are on call, the other person won’t get background disturbances. ANC is amazing.",5
Terrific,I loved these ..❤️My personal review after one month of usage.Pros: 1: The music is soo clear. 2: Design is just marvelous. No more words to speak.3: Battery backup is Decent. Cons: 1: Bass is not so punchy. If you are the person who loves bass then i would not recommend these.2: Latency is Average. If you wanna play games on these you will be disappointed for sure.I loved these because i am the person who loves pleasant music . Nothing ear (1) did its job... They are so light with ...,5

A Premium Well Packaged set of Earphones.,"My first TWS. Love the design and build so much. The sound is pretty good. Battery backup is good. Quick connectivity. In hand feel is very good. Feels good in the ear. Noise cancellation works, but personally after some time felt my ears tiring. So don't use it all the time. Feels like a very premium product. In-ear detection wasn't working well for me. So had to switch it off. Case picks up a lot of scratches.",5
Highly recommended,"Excellent sound quality, very nice design and very unique look among TWSs. The sound Saperation is very also excellent and bass is very great. Noise cancellation is also on par. Overall very good set of TWS and are also value for money. Go for it",5
Highly recommended,"The Nothing Ear 1 are fancy-looking and iconic as the brand intended them to be, bringing many thoughtful additions — such as a comfortable design and ANCThey do boast a unique transparent design that shows off some of the inner workings of the buds and case, but it’s rather limited to some surfaces. We’d have liked Nothing to push this idea furtherGood quality plastics, soft silicone and a lightweight design combine to give them a snug fit. If you’re someone that usually struggles to find ...",5
Terrific,"The Nothing ear (1) was one of my best purchases , It is Just like Airpods pro The only thing it lacks is Bass a bit more bass will make it the best in the Whole segment overall great experience and , A lot of bugs but with updates they can be fixed Good job by nothing , Impressive",5

Fabulous!,Everything is good but there should be more features in applications which we not able to see now hoe update can make it better otherwise good in this prize range .. and I think battery should be more efficient,5
Super!,"I like this earbud , i can easily recommend you for now price is been dropped at rs.4999 which is a value for money product. Sound quality  is good . ANC is working Excellent. For pubg like games i recommend you to play in low latency mode or putting ANC on , you will get less lag. Not perfect for gaming but ok you can handle with it also. And battery backup with ANC 3.5 hours it last . Without ANC maybe 4-5 hour earbud on 1 full Charge. With case it will long for 1.5 or 2 Day easily. Overall...",5
Worth every penny,"Quite astonishing with the packaging and designing. I am not able to reconnect with mobile after the buds are left unused after sometime as it automatically powers off, which is a good feature to save power. But at the same time, somehow feel like without using the case, I like to connect it again. Apart from that part everything looks perfect if you're a normal user who crave for a TWS.",5
Perfect product!,AmazingFirst impression: I just opened the pack and I am totally surprised by the build quality. The black and white color looks premium. And material looks expensive. I enjoyed unboxing it. The extra  earplugs are arranged in good fashion. The charging cable is transparently braided. ANC stops the fan noise. Touch controls are awesome.The product is worthy of its price. I wish Nothing releases cover for charging case so that so it doesn't get scratches.,5
Simply awesome,"They are great piece of artwork, the design and the looks will make u immediately fall in love with these budsNow about the actual performance They sound great, the mids lows and highs are balance and not overdoneThe feature ANC and touch control also work fine The only annoying thing is the implementation of in ear detection,  it works but most of the times with false positives. The audio accidentally stops for no reason so I had to switch in ear detection off. Its just sw implementati...",5
Awesome,"If I could rate it 4.5 that would be perfect. The half star deduction for its design. It doesn't feel like nothing in my ear. But apart from that, the value for money is brilliant! Amazing quality at this price. I've used Apple airpods and there's hardly any difference. The ANC is not great but at this cost I'll happily accept the level of ANC these offer.If this falls in your budget, go for it without second thoughts. You won't regret it.",5
Best in the market!,Well do not aspect sound quality like super good!I myself owner of Sonys wh 1000xm3 is telling that its a no competition to premium products!But this has its own classPremium looks!Definitely buy if you want to get good alternative or premium at cheaper price!Got it just because of looks,5

Absolute rubbish!,Spent 5.5k for NOTHINGGiving review after 1week of usingDesign:Fitting is problem for small ears. We will get pain in the ear after 1hr of using .Sound:Average and plain sound only. No base at all.

Terrible product,The right earpod stopped working after a month,1
Useless product,"Within a month of usage, right ear bud started running out of battery within an hour of use while the left one only reaches 90% battery level.",1
Horrible,"I dont quite like this one.Normally I dont keep charging case with me always, I carry only earbuds with me. But this earbuds cant be turned on without charging case which is so annoying, because charging is really bigBesides these earbuds stays on standby for only 5-10 minutes and then it turns off And wear detection dont work most of the times.",1
Not recommended at all,It gives me connectivity issues. And keeps making strange noises in between. Not as smooth as i had imagined it to be. Sound is good. Noise cancellation is decent. But sometimes only one side connects and i have to put it in the case to re connect. Some times it disconnects from my laptop and most of the times it keeps making a beep at random. Not happy. The hype was all fake,1
Terrible product,My Right ear piece stopped charging just after 2 months of usage,1
Horrible,Worst headset,1
Unsatisfactory,Received a fault pair. One of the buds is getting drained within 29 minutes.,1
Utterly Disappointed,"It definetly was a horrible experience buying nothing from 5999It disconnects everytime u move your head, u touch ur ear, so dont waste ur money on it.",1
Don't waste your money,"Worst battery back up won't even stay for 2 hrs, better to for another product like boat or any other's in the market with a better back up",1
Terrible product,Battery drain issue plz don’t buy this product,1
Utterly Disappointed,right side earphone does not connect.,1
Absolute rubbish!,Waste product...left earpiece has stopped working within one week and when checked with Flipkart it comes under no return policy it seems.,1
Did not meet expectations,Only 1 of my earphones is working.I tried connecting to my PC and other mobiles but still only the left earpiece was working.,1
Not recommended at all,Best ear phones with active noise cancellation you can buy at this price point. Go for them,1
Worst experience ever!,"Worst product,please take my earbud return .its trouble with connectivity in iphone 12 pro.please do needful",1
Don't waste your money,Right earbud failed in just 10 days.. No service centre as of now.. Product will easily take scratches and you cant even apply for return. I cared it like a baby but still it will take scratches..,1
Waste of money!,Don't waste your money on this product. Go wid Samsung buds or Google buds. No hi siri or ok google support,1
Useless product,I just unboxed my earphones and the left one has a warbling sound when I switch on noise cancellation. This is so disappointing. The first time I decided to invest in expensive earphones and this happens.,1
Waste of money!,call quality is to bad. the person on the other side cannot hear me clearly,1
Absolute rubbish!,"It's very buggy, 1. it constantly disconnects from the phone2. Very bad battery life3. Bass is mediocre4. Sound quality is same as a 500 rs earphonesDesign and build quality is good but what's the point if it constantly keeps disconnecting. The product experience of using it is very bad. And switching devices is a nightmare.",1
Don't waste your money,The touch controls don't work at all and even the noise cancellation and transparency mode stopped working within an hour of use. Absolute worst experience.,1
Worst experience ever!,"Initially the headset was doing okay. After some update, it don’t work properly, lots of disturbances, no clarity in voice, breaking issues",1
Worthless,waste of money i tell go with realmi buds air 2,1
Waste of money!,Worst sound quality and battery backup. Don't even think about the ANC in it. It just works for namesake. I recommend not to buy. Just overhyped piece of TECH.,1
Utterly Disappointed,Buds have lots of bugs 🤣 stay away.1. Hissy noise. 2. Noice Cancellation get on on off during call making the call experience worst. 3. Battery for both the buds gets discharged seperately4. Sound quality isn't constant.,1
Very poor,2 :30 hours battery Low Kwality bakwas money waste😔😭😭😭😭😭😭,1
Hated it!,It has become dysfunctional within 4 months.,1
Utterly Disappointed,"After few months of use the better drains very fast. One holds for 2 hrs, the other for just 45 mins.",1
Unsatisfactory,Having battery issue,1
Worthless,Calling problem and mic issue..not good sencer..many complain in vivo phon ..I m chang 3 different vivo phon same mic and sencer issue.,1
Not recommended at all,Only one bud connects automatically i need to place the other bud in case and on/off to connect everytime Resetting doesn’t helped.,1
Waste of money!,Coniting issue,1
Useless product,I bought it recently. The earphones have some issues. It gets paused after 15 seconds of play. Bluetooth gets disconnected very often.,1
Terrible product,"Right earbud touch and features like ANC, transparency mode not working from the first day",1
Unsatisfactory,Bad product,1
Utterly Disappointed,Worthless,1
A moment.,"ANC is not par with Airpods Pro but it is decent for its price. Can filter out all white noises like fan, ac, rain etc. Struggles with people talking. Can be considered a positive if you are in busy environment where you want to be heard when people call you. It can only store one Bluetooth pairing at a time, means you always have to create a new pairing with the next device. There is issues with ear detection, it may pause when taken out of ear but continues playing even when its not back ...",5
Super!,"Expect it to perform like a 6k earbuds and you will not be disappointed.Do not compare it with any earbuds above 10k.*Updated review after usage, Increased 1 Star since we got an update to use low latency mode which is very useful while gaming and audio video sync*What I liked---Good design, looks even better in person.-Build quality is good-Pristine bass.-Mid and Low tones are well balanced.-Call quality is above average.-Features are amazing.-Buds have low battery backup but th...",5
Fabulous!,"Excellent product, I didn't hope for this good. The product is amazing and the sound signature is also good, but there will be disappointment for bass lovers as the bass isn't that punchy but it is fine pumps in whenever you want.Better use the earpods with anc for better sound and I suggest to switch to more bass on app.Regarding app and software, app is clean as paper loved it .There are few bugs too, like disconnecting and right earplug disconnecting and in ear detection and not eq pres...",5
Good,"I pre-ordered this and received this 2 days back. I have used mivi, boat, JBL before. I really felt for 6000 the headphones could have sounded better. The mid and the lows are ok'ish, not great! But high's are really not upto the mark. As per Design, I really love it. It fits perfectly in the ear and connectivity is really well made. It connects automatically as soon as I open the case. No hassles! The box is quite big in size and usb c port is cool. Have talked to people on earphones and n...",3
Not good,"One should definitely avoid this over hyped and expensive low quality ear buds. It has many design built flaws. Would you expect audio lag after paying 6k ? Yes, you get that. One of the bud might get disconnected for no reason. Accidental touch are sensed and intentional ones are ignored. Songs would pause for no reason and you keep on hitting it to get that started again. But eventually have to take out phone and do that from it. You would only be able to connect only one device with it. Ba...",2
Don't waste your money,"I got these headphones hoping for a revolutionary product like oneplus.I was sadly disappointed... The product out of the box worked fine (after 3 returns of defective products ) and I was ok with it... After just one week of usage I found the battery is draining super fast. The earphones last around 2 hours without noise canceling on calls, for music it's around 4 hours. I won't suggest the product to anyone Atleast till they rectify software, batteries and what not. One of my bad purchas...",1
Simply awesome,"UPDATED**PROS : #1) Looks even better than shown here!#2) Sound is AMAZING! (Airpods pro level amazing at this price)#3) Very comfortable in ear and weightless!#4) Gestures are awsm!#5) ANC - Satisfiable #6) Battery - Tbh, not amazing but OK!CONS : Being a new product from a new brand, you might encounter a few bugs.- Stopped working, contacted customer care, they arranged for a pickup so after-sales service is good as well.",5
Just wow!,"Overall a great value for money purchase which is one of the best in this price segment. Detailed review: Comfort - this is one of the biggest plus points, incredible comfort, it nestles beautifully in your ear without you even feeling it's there. Usability and connectivity - pairs and connects seamlessly and the auto detect when taken out of the ear works perfectly wellTouch controls : work very easily and very easy to get used toANC - adequate but not the most powerful. Can elimin...",5
Value-for-money,"Received today which is 2 days before original flipkart delivery schedule. Thanks to flipkart for such a prompt service. Love the unique design and build quality. Definitely stands out from the crowded templatized designed earbuds out there in market.Spoilt owning Sony WH1000 XM3 and Bose headphones, this is a pleasantly surprising package at such a price point. Does well on sound aspect but do not expect it to be exorbitantly good if you want to compare it to established industry leaders, ...",4
Good quality product,"Not everything, but definitely not nothing....Updated Review: 1 week in....

Classy product,Went over my expectations. The features are great. Good that NOTHING gave a software update already and hoping for more in case any bugs come up. Bugs are welcome as the company and product are absolutely new in market. Design is sleek and new. Can't really tell if battery is good as of now. But it seems to be 3.5-4/5 for now.,5
Fabulous!,Awesome tws earbuds at the price !!ANC & ENC is also right at the point. Also these pair is very comfy and punchy bass. Just go for it <3,5
Really Nice,Bought this pair of TWS yesterday and the ordering process was smooth. Okish packaging without any bubble wrap which concerned me but the product is safeI'm not a certified reviewer but below are my observation based on 1 day usage1. Hands-on experience was great2. Premium looking case and earphone3. No issue in connecting to my 4 year old OnePlus 54. Their proprietary app is good but has some bugs. Despite connecting the headphones to phone their app is showing not connected5. Fit - ...,4
Utterly Disappointed,"Okay. Will keep this short.Good stuff:Design is really unique, so if you are out her looking for something different this are the ones to go for..well for the time being atleast.Sound is also decent with good clarity and bass when you are streaming movies or listening to music.Battery back up is good runs for around 4 hrs before it runs out. Put it in the charging box for maybe half an hour or so and you are good for the next 2 hrs.It is really light...as in stupidly light..you won't fe...",1
Nice product,I am giving a full detailed review of this nothing ear one... First thing first the sound quality of this product is amazing... I used many ear buds but it was quite impressive... If you listen soft music... Even hard music are good... The noise cancellation is good but it needs more improvement... Same with transparency.... Mic is also avarage... You may face problems with high speed winds... Overall the music quality of this product is amazing... Don't compare with 20k plus pricing earbuds....,4
Terrific purchase,"Best earbuds you can get, stylish design and well build and sound that sounds premium. Pros: 1. Top notch sound quality and you can tweak it with (Nothing ear app) available in Playstore.2. Great build quality and design3. Good noise cancellation4. Supports wireless charging5. Splash proof6. Low latency in games7. Ear detection works well8. Great call quality9. You can update its firmware through the appCons:1. No customised equalizer maybe in future in-app update we will get i...",5
Good choice,"The design is the only thing that is worth spending 6k on. Rest everything is pretty okayish. I found my realme BT wireless earphones performing better that these. The app is still buggy, long way to go for Nothing.",4
Highly recommended,These are the osm ear buds at this price range ANC is good sound quality is good battery backup osm Overall satisfied and best ear buds at this price range Must buy ☺️,5
Delightful,"Firstly the looks of the product is so attractive and fits in the ear very well.1. Don't expect a very well noise cancellation for this price. It is really doing its job well. I will give 4/5 for noise cancellation for its job at this price.2. Low sound. You'll end up raising your media volume while listening to music. Calls are clear tho.3. Bass is decent and not great. High and low Notes can be felt but not so crystal clear.4. Touch sense is recognised very well with triple tap, touch a...",4
Delightful,In this segment this is quite impressive. Well if you are looking for truly ANC then I would suggest you to for upper range. But Carl Pei has put whatever he had to make this. Small detailng that you will notice only one drawback is the case. It's not sturdy which I guess is a must and the sensor sometimes doesn't distinguish between human touch nd pillow. Well that might be resolved by firmware update. Overall it's a go from me,4
Wonderful,"I can see, lot of effort has been put make this piece of gem. The connectivity and battery backup are very good. Sound quality is way better than what I did expect.But bit disappointed with comfort when I wear earbuds, may be I had over expectation ;) Any way.. it's a successful first step to make the user feel ""there is nothing in the ear (no earbuds!) when we use it"". I am excited to see what more you offer in the next model of Nothing earbuds.",5
Worth every penny,"I researched a lot of TWS ranging from 1k to 10k. This is the best deal I found in terms of money and quality. Surely it is one of the best TWS available in the market. ANC is okay but I didn't like the ANC feature as it will appear like your ears are blocked and soon can create a headache. So if you are someone who likes to be light on ears, then please don't look for ANC, you will anyway have to keep it turned OFF.1) Sound quality is great but not as great as KZN pro (ofcourse single driv...",5
Does the job,"They're fine at first Now after like 3 months ,speakers degraded ,Theres a cracking sound from right piece .left one does it too ,but to a lesser degree compared to the right one .Spend your 6K on something else ,this seems to be an experimental product",3
Simply awesome,"Excellent product from Nothing.. Worth for the price, worth the hype. Good packaging. And the sound quality is good.. If you are expecting some high-end experience for sound quality or ANC then this is not the product for you.. But for 6k, you get all the basic needs that is needed for a TWS such as design, build quality, battery life, decent ANC, good sound quality. Hope this helps..!",5
Perfect product!,"I believe that a typical listener, who has tested very few earphones in their life, will be impressed and most likely like these. The sound, functionality, etc. should please you. There is no reason to expect these budget earphones to perform as well as top dogs in the field, but they stand above the rest in their price range - MY OPINIONSound : They are very BASS focused, with crisp notes and the bass is wicked. Oh yeah, and they are extremely loud, like real loud. Big shout out to the lad...",5
Pretty good,"Great value for money purchase in this price segment.PROS:- 1. Sound is amazing, has good balance between bass and treble.2. ANC is average.3. Very comfortable to ear, can wear it for longer duration.4. Build quality is good but one might have to wrap it to prevent scratches. CONS:-1. Case is to large to carry in pocket.2.

Wonderful,"Technical first:Honest and mid range budget customer experience:As most of them are saying the sound is really crisp and rich.Bass is heavy if you put On ANC plus the 'More Bass' EQ from the app.Balanced EQ (default) is crisp and OK for most of the users.For me I like 'more bass' and 'voice' for podcasts.I was lucky enough that I didn't get any bugs while pairing or using it in the first week,Since I got two updates in one week, meaning that they are listening to the community.Everythin...",5
Terrific purchase,"Value for money .I will recommend if you are looking for best TWS ,  better sound quality & ANC in this price range.",5
Must buy!,"Previously I was using OnePlus buds Z, which are optimised for bass. So In got use to the level of bass. When heard Nothing ear 1, I was not happy with the level of bass which I had earlier heard. But I decided to let me burn first, my God they came out as even better the thumpness, low bass(20-50hz) is extremely heavy.1- Bass is lit !2- The mid are good !3- Highs could have been better, but you wont feel it if you haven't heard something of studio quality.4- Battery back-up(buds) is aro...",5
Mind-blowing purchase,Why some people say just this product sounds good... This product sounds  excellent.. i also used airpods pro... I think this is better than airpods pro.. this nothing has got everything in balanced highs mids lows... Aipods are a bit trebelish ... Everyone think apple products are perfect.. but nothing is perfect... ANC  is okaish.. for the price in mind ... This is way too ahead,5
Very Good,"Great sound quality. Great built quality. Would highly recommend over other Asian Brands. The ANC does its job nicely. Just one drawback, case-size. There is a lot of negative space in the case that could have been avoided. It feels big to carry around inyour pocket. Overall, I would recommend a BUY.!",4
Wonderful,Product is very stylish and performance is good.But I have observed eco / buzz sound suddenly in left ear pod. It was set right after switching off and on the device. Need to wait whether this leads to permanent quality issue.,4
Good choice,Nothing ear(1) is an absolute pleasure to try at such an affordable price. Even the bigger company hasn't paid the attention as this company does with its design.You don't feel the buds in your ears such a balanced weight.You can go for this to experience decent level of noise cancellation at this price range. Sit under running fan and play with noise cancellation to experience them real time.Controlling volume on the buds are well appreciated.All gestures work without any problem.Cons...,4
Fair,Pros / - battery life is good . Connectivity and range is good . Sound is better than average but Can’t compare to AirPods. Comfort in ear is good but not great. Over all a good product . Worth buying. A good price should not be more  4K,3
Nice,"I love the product. But it seems like the case is acting up, the charge simply goes to zero without any proper use. This has happened twice with me for now. At one time its green and 100% charged as shown in the case and when I plug it out and put it back in charging it's charging again and stays under red color charging mode for more than 30 minutes, giving a surety that it never was fully charged. Maybe a faulty piece but I will exchange it and see",3
Just wow!,"I would give them a 4.5 if they had the option, but because these are incredible, especially for the price point, I have rounded up.The highs:1. The sound quality is top notch and rivals the AirPods Pro. 2. The case and the buds look gorgeous.3. In ear feel is absolutely fantastic! The mids:1. The sound from the microphone is crisp, with no complaints from callers. 2. Transparency mode works fairly well.3. Battery is average. Lasted me 3.5-4 hours with transparency on while toggling...",5
Terrific purchase,Received mine today at namma mysuru Karnataka. very fast delivery by flipkart. Product quality is good. sounds fine. balanced sound. for 5999 its value for money. All gestures works fine. With ANC On it sounds best. voice calls are good.,5
Great product,I'm not joking but I liked the sound of my wired jbl earphones that were of 650bucks. And this gives much better sound so complaints on that. I know some people are really keen on the sound quality but u have to consider that this is a tws at a price much lower than the airpods or sonys. And considering that I think this gives a pretty much all round performance. I'm in love with the design. Just hope that they last longer coz I am a stringy person and this is the most i have ever spent on a ...,5
Fabulous!,Mind blowing sound for this price range.. Works very well with my mi 11 ultra.. Once again Carl pie proved his best with this device.. Go for it blindly.,5
Does the job,"Got mine delivered just a week ago and have been listening to these on a daily basis. Here's a full review of how it goes:Sound - 4/5Amazing sound signature at the price, these could be compared fairly with other budget options but calling them airpods Pro replacement is far fetched. They are great at what they do and hope the brand grows to understand how to hold different levels of sound. P.S. there's only preset equalizers on the app and cannot customise it whatsoever.Build - 3/5Earp...",3
Great product,"Delighted after arrival, but the touch is a bit too sensitive for my taste as anc turns off even with non capacitive touches of things such as pillows hence switched one tap hold off, sound quality simply put is balanced and immersive to all ears no bass heaviness present and mids sound quite beautiful for the price. But special mention to the level of anc at this price is priceless and also the weight is not too light that you forget you have something in your ears while opening a tshirt and...",5

Delightful,"Best built quality, best sound and bass quality,but I felt bad while  gaming.there is huge latency. I won't recommend these tws ear buds for gaming. For all round purpose it's an best option for that price category. And also  the ANC and transparency mode is the best part in this device. And also I loved the wireless charging feature in this price range. I hope that  we can expect more features through updates",4
Brilliant,"Got this for 4k only.Definitely worth 4k and definitely not worth 7k.😂😂Sound quality is good.Very very comfortable.Bass is not overpowered, which is good.Vocals could have been better.Sounds better than oneplus buds z. But but but the call quality is worst.",5
Value-for-money,"Its a good product as compared to hype, but not ground breaking. Sound quality is good specially bass, and more bass mode enhances it further. Although user eq should had been there. ANC is average to good, nothing to complaint about, nothing to boast about. Lowers the hums, but high pitch sounds enter the ear. Build is good. Battery backup is average at best. Just 4 5 hours max.

I think this is better than airpods pro.. this nothing has got everything in balanced highs mids lows... Aipods are a bit trebelish ... Everyone think apple products are perfect.. but nothing is perfect... ANC  is okaish.. for the price in mind ... This is way too ahead,5
Just wow!,"I would give them a 4.5 if they had the option, but because these are incredible, especially for the price point, I have rounded up.The highs:1. The sound quality is top notch and rivals the AirPods Pro. 2. The case and the buds look gorgeous.3. In ear feel is absolutely fantastic! The mids:1. The sound from the microphone is crisp, with no complaints from callers. 2. Transparency mode works fairly well.3. Battery is average. Lasted me 3.5-4 hours with transparency on while toggling...",5
Terrific purchase,Received mine today at namma mysuru Karnataka. very fast delivery by flipkart. Product quality is good. sounds fine. balanced sound. for 5999 its value for money. All gestures works fine. With ANC On it sounds best. voice calls are good.,5
Great product,I'm not joking but I liked the sound of my wired jbl earphones that were of 650bucks. And this gives much better sound so complaints on that. I know some people are really keen on the sound quality but u have to consider that this is a tws at a price much lower than the airpods or sonys. And considering that I think this gives a pretty much all round performance. I'm in love with the design. Just hope that they last longer coz I am a stringy person and this is the most i have ever spent on a ...,5
Fabulous!,Mind blowing sound for this price range.. Works very well with my mi 11 ultra.. Once again Carl pie proved his best with this device.. Go for it blindly.,5
Great product,"Delighted after arrival, but the touch is a bit too sensitive for my taste as anc turns off even with non capacitive touches of things such as pillows hence switched one tap hold off, sound quality simply put is balanced and immersive to all ears no bass heaviness present and mids sound quite beautiful for the price. But special mention to the level of anc at this price is priceless and also the weight is not too light that you forget you have something in your ears while opening a tshirt and...",5
Brilliant,"Got this for 4k only.Definitely worth 4k and definitely not worth 7k.😂😂Sound quality is good.Very very comfortable.Bass is not overpowered, which is good.Vocals could have been better.Sounds better than oneplus buds z. But but but the call quality is worst.",5
Worth every penny,Sound quality is this  price is really amazing just loved them design really great fits in ear really comfortably noise cancellation is also really good worth the money.,5
Mind-blowing purchase,OMG This is the best earphone there is .I mean earphone better than this one is ipods pro which are like 20k.This one is like quater the price and it delivers.very satisfied wth the product.,5
Must buy!,First the design is unique.The system is different compair to othe ear buds.The clarity of sound system is awesome.Sensor of this nothing ear 1 is very smooth to useAnd the buds are really weightless and very smooth,5
Terrific,"Looks - This is one of its kind. Transparent and circuit visible .Sound - Sound is very decent though you won’t get much Bass in it but yes sound is crystal and clear. You can also select some sound options in the Nothing Ear (1) app.Call quality - This is the main reason why I wanted a Better Ear phones and believe me this is the best in this range. Even while riding a bike if you are on call, the other person won’t get background disturbances. ANC is amazing.",5
Terrific,I loved these ..❤️My personal review after one month of usage.Pros: 1: The music is soo clear. 2: Design is just marvelous. No more words to speak.3: Battery backup is Decent. Cons: 1: Bass is not so punchy. If you are the person who loves bass then i would not recommend these.2: Latency is Average. If you wanna play games on these you will be disappointed for sure.I loved these because i am the person who loves pleasant music . Nothing ear (1) did its job... They are so light with ...,5
Highly recommended,"Sound quality and comfort very nice And connectivity is very good for Bluetooth I got it  rs 4,500 in big billion sale in this price range its sound quality superbb.music lovers are  fully satisfied",5
A Premium Well Packaged set of Earphones.,"My first TWS. Love the design and build so much. The sound is pretty good. Battery backup is good. Quick connectivity. In hand feel is very good. Feels good in the ear. Noise cancellation works, but personally after some time felt my ears tiring. So don't use it all the time. Feels like a very premium product. In-ear detection wasn't working well for me. So had to switch it off. Case picks up a lot of scratches.",5
Highly recommended,"Excellent sound quality, very nice design and very unique look among TWSs. The sound Saperation is very also excellent and bass is very great. Noise cancellation is also on par. Overall very good set of TWS and are also value for money. Go for it",5
Highly recommended,"The Nothing Ear 1 are fancy-looking and iconic as the brand intended them to be, bringing many thoughtful additions — such as a comfortable design and ANCThey do boast a unique transparent design that shows off some of the inner workings of the buds and case, but it’s rather limited to some surfaces. We’d have liked Nothing to push this idea furtherGood quality plastics, soft silicone and a lightweight design combine to give them a snug fit. If you’re someone that usually struggles to find ...",5
Terrific,"The Nothing ear (1) was one of my best purchases , It is Just like Airpods pro The only thing it lacks is Bass a bit more bass will make it the best in the Whole segment overall great experience and , A lot of bugs but with updates they can be fixed Good job by nothing , Impressive",5
Brilliant,Beast tws than any otherI m a  user but these tws connectivity to iphone superb and fast thank you nothing And flip kart for fast delivery,5
Simply awesome,"A very Good product from Nothing!Design and Sound quality is Top Notch.ANC and Bass are good but it could have been much better.If you are looking for a good TWS with in 5-6K budget, blindly go for it.It's worth buying",5
Must buy!,Got a delivery on time.. Nothing ear 1 it's best in class the noise cancellation it's good the sound quality it's perfect really loved it..,5
Fabulous!,Everything is good but there should be more features in applications which we not able to see now hoe update can make it better otherwise good in this prize range .. and I think battery should be more efficient,5
Super!,"I like this earbud , i can easily recommend you for now price is been dropped at rs.4999 which is a value for money product. Sound quality  is good . ANC is working Excellent. For pubg like games i recommend you to play in low latency mode or putting ANC on , you will get less lag. Not perfect for gaming but ok you can handle with it also. And battery backup with ANC 3.5 hours it last . Without ANC maybe 4-5 hour earbud on 1 full Charge. With case it will long for 1.5 or 2 Day easily. Overall...",5
Worth every penny,"Quite astonishing with the packaging and designing. I am not able to reconnect with mobile after the buds are left unused after sometime as it automatically powers off, which is a good feature to save power. But at the same time, somehow feel like without using the case, I like to connect it again. Apart from that part everything looks perfect if you're a normal user who crave for a TWS.",5
Perfect product!,AmazingFirst impression: I just opened the pack and I am totally surprised by the build quality. The black and white color looks premium. And material looks expensive. I enjoyed unboxing it. The extra  earplugs are arranged in good fashion. The charging cable is transparently braided. ANC stops the fan noise. Touch controls are awesome.The product is worthy of its price. I wish Nothing releases cover for charging case so that so it doesn't get scratches.,5
Simply awesome,"They are great piece of artwork, the design and the looks will make u immediately fall in love with these budsNow about the actual performance They sound great, the mids lows and highs are balance and not overdoneThe feature ANC and touch control also work fine The only annoying thing is the implementation of in ear detection,  it works but most of the times with false positives. The audio accidentally stops for no reason so I had to switch in ear detection off. Its just sw implementati...",5
Awesome,"If I could rate it 4.5 that would be perfect. The half star deduction for its design. It doesn't feel like nothing in my ear. But apart from that, the value for money is brilliant! Amazing quality at this price. I've used Apple airpods and there's hardly any difference. The ANC is not great but at this cost I'll happily accept the level of ANC these offer.If this falls in your budget, go for it without second thoughts. You won't regret it.",5
Best in the market!,Well do not aspect sound quality like super good!I myself owner of Sonys wh 1000xm3 is telling that its a no competition to premium products!But this has its own classPremium looks!Definitely buy if you want to get good alternative or premium at cheaper price!Got it just because of looks,5
Brilliant,Amazing product overall value for money,5
Highly recommended,Just received the product and would say its a wonderful built and sounding product by Nothing. Don’t trust all review of the product on YouTube and its a beast in this price range and wish future products by Nothing will put other run for their money 😉 Luckily I’m the first reviewer of the product over here 😂,5
Brilliant,"These sound unreal.Bought them with my first salary, Worth every penny. You won't regret buying these, Loved it❣️",5
Awesome,The product is amazing. The build quality is perfect.The base is good...You can customize it though the app.The only con is:After continuous usage you can find scratches with the charging box as it is transparent..You can use skins or cases to avoid that,5
Super!,"These are beautiful. I had airpods pro before switching to android gave these a try and these are way more comfortable. Tried them at the gym 10/10 tried them in an aircraft 10/10. Don't think of negative reviews. This product is excellent design wise, sound wise, and cost wise... Cheers!",5
Just wow!,I Got today Till Now It Is good.,5
Fabulous!,"Oh my god! I can not suggest any other TWS under 10k! Elite features and seamless performance ensures mind boggling music experience. I observed right ear bud disconnects after long and continuous usage, but its a software blip which might be rectified in further updates. But believe me, if you are a beginner and doesn't want any risk to be taken while buying, simply press the orange button on ( buy now). Beast!",5
Don't waste your money,"I got these headphones hoping for a revolutionary product like oneplus.I was sadly disappointed... The product out of the box worked fine (after 3 returns of defective products ) and I was ok with it... After just one week of usage I found the battery is draining super fast.

Waste of money!,"You will find a lot of pros in other reviews, just read it. But I am here to talk about the things I didn't like very much about this product.1. First and foremost, the battery back up. It is safe to say it does not the perform as specified. You cannot go 24 hrs with ANC on (while using case- just in case anyone is confused). Maximum I could stretch was 18-20 hrs. Bear in mind I am not a tech reviewer just an ordinary guy who used it throughout the day.2. ANC is decent but there much left t...",1
Useless product,The product has so many bugs. It keeps disconnecting multiple time and some times one of the buds just gets disconnected randomly. Also music stops randomly for few seconds. Dont waste your money on this product. The firmware update in the software didn't solve the disconnection issue. Don't fall for the hype around this product. It looks cool but not upto the mark in terms of software and connection maintainance standards. You can get other TWS for lesser price instead of spending 6k for a b...,1
"Cheap Product, most users received defective piece.","Right ear bud not working and the case not charging, I guess most of the users are facing the same issue (of right ear bud not working) hence returned the product.",1
Horrible,When I got my wireless earphones the right earpiece was charged at 40 percent and the left at 80 percent. I charged the case and the earphones to 100 percent. After using it for a while the battery of right earpiece decreased to 40 percent and the left earpiece to 80 percent. Touch controls are really bad and the proximity sensor does not work properly. If the stem of the earpiece is not at a certain distance from your face it will spaz out and pause the video whenever it wants. Maybe my ear ...,1
Hated it!,"After a single charge, The earbuds stopped workingNow the case light indicator is also not working. If anyone knows the solution.. please let me know",1
Defective Product,"Received a defective product. Right earbud doesn't charge with the case, and battery for right earbud gets depleted within 1 hour. Flipkart has accepted the replacement will update if the replacement works properly.",1
Worthless,DON'T BUY these...  they are become pathetic for me..  ANC not working properly.. On/Off automatically while watching a movie /videos on mobile..  The main issue is songs automatically play /pause again n again.. such a worst earphone....  DON'T BUY DON'T BUY,1
Horrible,"Sound quality is good no doubt in that but rest of things aren't worth it. App is buggy, earphone gets disconnected by itself. The charging box is too fragile and catches scratches very easily.",1
Terrible product,"Received faulty earbuds from flipkart, the right ear buds charge finishes within 30 mins. Emailed the company but they said can’t help as you bought from 3rd party (flipkart).Very bad experience, only able to use left ear buds properly.",1
Hated it!,"Defective , right earpod not working",1
Utterly Disappointed,"Okay, so let me break down, why I have given it a 1 star.Number 1 - when I first received the product, I couldn't make it to work with my daily phone or with my backup phone. I got really worried and I tried to connect the headsets with another 3/4 devices, including 2 laptops but It was not connecting to any of them.

Terrible product,The right earpod stopped working after a month,1
Useless product,"Within a month of usage, right ear bud started running out of battery within an hour of use while the left one only reaches 90% battery level.",1
Horrible,"I dont quite like this one.Normally I dont keep charging case with me always, I carry only earbuds with me. But this earbuds cant be turned on without charging case which is so annoying, because charging is really bigBesides these earbuds stays on standby for only 5-10 minutes and then it turns off And wear detection dont work most of the times.",1
Not recommended at all,It gives me connectivity issues. And keeps making strange noises in between. Not as smooth as i had imagined it to be. Sound is good. Noise cancellation is decent. But sometimes only one side connects and i have to put it in the case to re connect. Some times it disconnects from my laptop and most of the times it keeps making a beep at random. Not happy. The hype was all fake,1
Terrible product,My Right ear piece stopped charging just after 2 months of usage,1
Horrible,Worst headset,1
Unsatisfactory,Received a fault pair. One of the buds is getting drained within 29 minutes.,1

Don't waste your money,"Worst battery back up won't even stay for 2 hrs, better to for another product like boat or any other's in the market with a better back up",1
Terrible product,Battery drain issue plz don’t buy this product,1
Utterly Disappointed,right side earphone does not connect.,1
Absolute rubbish!,Waste product...left earpiece has stopped working within one week and when checked with Flipkart it comes under no return policy it seems.,1
Did not meet expectations,Only 1 of my earphones is working.I tried connecting to my PC and other mobiles but still only the left earpiece was working.,1
Not recommended at all,Best ear phones with active noise cancellation you can buy at this price point. Go for them,1
Worst experience ever!,"Worst product,please take my earbud return .its trouble with connectivity in iphone 12 pro.please do needful",1
Don't waste your money,Right earbud failed in just 10 days.. No service centre as of now.. Product will easily take scratches and you cant even apply for return. I cared it like a baby but still it will take scratches..,1
Waste of money!,Don't waste your money on this product. Go wid Samsung buds or Google buds. No hi siri or ok google support,1
Useless product,I just unboxed my earphones and the left one has a warbling sound when I switch on noise cancellation. This is so disappointing. The first time I decided to invest in expensive earphones and this happens.,1

And switching devices is a nightmare.",1
Don't waste your money,The touch controls don't work at all and even the noise cancellation and transparency mode stopped working within an hour of use. Absolute worst experience.,1
Worst experience ever!,"Initially the headset was doing okay. After some update, it don’t work properly, lots of disturbances, no clarity in voice, breaking issues",1

Waste of money!,Worst sound quality and battery backup. Don't even think about the ANC in it. It just works for namesake. I recommend not to buy. Just overhyped piece of TECH.,1
Utterly Disappointed,Buds have lots of bugs 🤣 stay away.1. Hissy noise. 2. Noice Cancellation get on on off during call making the call experience worst. 3. Battery for both the buds gets discharged seperately4. Sound quality isn't constant.,1
Very poor,2 :30 hours battery Low Kwality bakwas money waste😔😭😭😭😭😭😭,1

Unsatisfactory,Bad product,1
Utterly Disappointed,Worthless,1
A moment.,"ANC is not par with Airpods Pro but it is decent for its price. Can filter out all white noises like fan, ac, rain etc. Struggles with people talking. Can be considered a positive if you are in busy environment where you want to be heard when people call you. It can only store one Bluetooth pairing at a time, means you always have to create a new pairing with the next device. There is issues with ear detection, it may pause when taken out of ear but continues playing even when its not back ...",5

Good,"I pre-ordered this and received this 2 days back. I have used mivi, boat, JBL before. I really felt for 6000 the headphones could have sounded better. The mid and the lows are ok'ish, not great! But high's are really not upto the mark. As per Design, I really love it. It fits perfectly in the ear and connectivity is really well made. It connects automatically as soon as I open the case. No hassles! The box is quite big in size and usb c port is cool. Have talked to people on earphones and n...",3
Not good,"One should definitely avoid this over hyped and expensive low quality ear buds. It has many design built flaws. Would you expect audio lag after paying 6k ? Yes, you get that. One of the bud might get disconnected for no reason. Accidental touch are sensed and intentional ones are ignored. Songs would pause for no reason and you keep on hitting it to get that started again. But eventually have to take out phone and do that from it. You would only be able to connect only one device with it. Ba...",2

Value-for-money,"Received today which is 2 days before original flipkart delivery schedule. Thanks to flipkart for such a prompt service. Love the unique design and build quality. Definitely stands out from the crowded templatized designed earbuds out there in market.Spoilt owning Sony WH1000 XM3 and Bose headphones, this is a pleasantly surprising package at such a price point.

Classy product,Went over my expectations. The features are great. Good that NOTHING gave a software update already and hoping for more in case any bugs come up. Bugs are welcome as the company and product are absolutely new in market. Design is sleek and new. Can't really tell if battery is good as of now. But it seems to be 3.5-4/5 for now.,5
Fabulous!,Awesome tws earbuds at the price !!ANC & ENC is also right at the point. Also these pair is very comfy and punchy bass. Just go for it <3,5
Really Nice,Bought this pair of TWS yesterday and the ordering process was smooth. Okish packaging without any bubble wrap which concerned me but the product is safeI'm not a certified reviewer but below are my observation based on 1 day usage1. Hands-on experience was great2.

Nice product,I am giving a full detailed review of this nothing ear one... First thing first the sound quality of this product is amazing... I used many ear buds but it was quite impressive... If you listen soft music... Even hard music are good... The noise cancellation is good but it needs more improvement... Same with transparency.... Mic is also avarage... You may face problems with high speed winds... Overall the music quality of this product is amazing... Don't compare with 20k plus pricing earbuds....,4
Terrific purchase,"Best earbuds you can get, stylish design and well build and sound that sounds premium. Pros: 1. Top notch sound quality and you can tweak it with (Nothing ear app) available in Playstore.2. Great build quality and design3. Good noise cancellation4. Supports wireless charging5. Splash proof6. Low latency in games7. Ear detection works well8. Great call quality9. You can update its firmware through the appCons:1. No customised equalizer maybe in future in-app update we will get i...",5
Good choice,"The design is the only thing that is worth spending 6k on. Rest everything is pretty okayish. I found my realme BT wireless earphones performing better that these. The app is still buggy, long way to go for Nothing.",4
Highly recommended,These are the osm ear buds at this price range ANC is good sound quality is good battery backup osm Overall satisfied and best ear buds at this price range Must buy ☺️,5
Delightful,"Firstly the looks of the product is so attractive and fits in the ear very well.1. Don't expect a very well noise cancellation for this price. It is really doing its job well. I will give 4/5 for noise cancellation for its job at this price.2. Low sound. You'll end up raising your media volume while listening to music. Calls are clear tho.3. Bass is decent and not great. High and low Notes can be felt but not so crystal clear.4. Touch sense is recognised very well with triple tap, touch a...",4
Delightful,In this segment this is quite impressive. Well if you are looking for truly ANC then I would suggest you to for upper range. But Carl Pei has put whatever he had to make this. Small detailng that you will notice only one drawback is the case. It's not sturdy which I guess is a must and the sensor sometimes doesn't distinguish between human touch nd pillow. Well that might be resolved by firmware update. Overall it's a go from me,4
Wonderful,"I can see, lot of effort has been put make this piece of gem. The connectivity and battery backup are very good. Sound quality is way better than what I did expect.But bit disappointed with comfort when I wear earbuds, may be I had over expectation ;) Any way.. it's a successful first step to make the user feel ""there is nothing in the ear (no earbuds!) when we use it"". I am excited to see what more you offer in the next model of Nothing earbuds.",5
Worth every penny,"I researched a lot of TWS ranging from 1k to 10k. This is the best deal I found in terms of money and quality. Surely it is one of the best TWS available in the market. ANC is okay but I didn't like the ANC feature as it will appear like your ears are blocked and soon can create a headache. So if you are someone who likes to be light on ears, then please don't look for ANC, you will anyway have to keep it turned OFF.1) Sound quality is great but not as great as KZN pro (ofcourse single driv...",5
Does the job,"They're fine at first Now after like 3 months ,speakers degraded ,Theres a cracking sound from right piece .left one does it too ,but to a lesser degree compared to the right one .Spend your 6K on something else ,this seems to be an experimental product",3
Simply awesome,"Excellent product from Nothing.. Worth for the price, worth the hype. Good packaging. And the sound quality is good.. If you are expecting some high-end experience for sound quality or ANC then this is not the product for you.. But for 6k, you get all the basic needs that is needed for a TWS such as design, build quality, battery life, decent ANC, good sound quality. Hope this helps..!",5
Perfect product!,"I believe that a typical listener, who has tested very few earphones in their life, will be impressed and most likely like these. The sound, functionality, etc. should please you. There is no reason to expect these budget earphones to perform as well as top dogs in the field, but they stand above the rest in their price range - MY OPINIONSound : They are very BASS focused, with crisp notes and the bass is wicked. Oh yeah, and they are extremely loud, like real loud. Big shout out to the lad...",5
Pretty good,"Great value for money purchase in this price segment.PROS:- 1. Sound is amazing, has good balance between bass and treble.2. ANC is average.3. Very comfortable to ear, can wear it for longer duration.4. Build quality is good but one might have to wrap it to prevent scratches. CONS:-1. Case is to large to carry in pocket.2. Battery is average, depends upon ANC.3. Sound leak on volume above 70.",4
Wonderful,"Technical first:Honest and mid range budget customer experience:As most of them are saying the sound is really crisp and rich.Bass is heavy if you put On ANC plus the 'More Bass' EQ from the app.Balanced EQ (default) is crisp and OK for most of the users.For me I like 'more bass' and 'voice' for podcasts.I was lucky enough that I didn't get any bugs while pairing or using it in the first week,Since I got two updates in one week, meaning that they are listening to the community.Everythin...",5
Terrific purchase,"Value for money .I will recommend if you are looking for best TWS ,  better sound quality & ANC in this price range.",5
Must buy!,"Previously I was using OnePlus buds Z, which are optimised for bass. So In got use to the level of bass. When heard Nothing ear 1, I was not happy with the level of bass which I had earlier heard. But I decided to let me burn first, my God they came out as even better the thumpness, low bass(20-50hz) is extremely heavy.1- Bass is lit !2- The mid are good !3- Highs could have been better, but you wont feel it if you haven't heard something of studio quality.4- Battery back-up(buds) is aro...",5
Mind-blowing purchase,Why some people say just this product sounds good... This product sounds  excellent.. i also used airpods pro... I think this is better than airpods pro.. this nothing has got everything in balanced highs mids lows... Aipods are a bit trebelish ... Everyone think apple products are perfect.. but nothing is perfect... ANC  is okaish.. for the price in mind ... This is way too ahead,5
Very Good,"Great sound quality. Great built quality. Would highly recommend over other Asian Brands. The ANC does its job nicely. Just one drawback, case-size. There is a lot of negative space in the case that could have been avoided. It feels big to carry around inyour pocket. Overall, I would recommend a BUY.!",4
Wonderful,Product is very stylish and performance is good.But I have observed eco / buzz sound suddenly in left ear pod. It was set right after switching off and on the device. Need to wait whether this leads to permanent quality issue.,4
Good choice,Nothing ear(1) is an absolute pleasure to try at such an affordable price. Even the bigger company hasn't paid the attention as this company does with its design.You don't feel the buds in your ears such a balanced weight.You can go for this to experience decent level of noise cancellation at this price range. Sit under running fan and play with noise cancellation to experience them real time.Controlling volume on the buds are well appreciated.All gestures work without any problem.Cons...,4
Fair,Pros / - battery life is good . Connectivity and range is good . Sound is better than average but Can’t compare to AirPods. Comfort in ear is good but not great. Over all a good product . Worth buying. A good price should not be more  4K,3
Nice,"I love the product. But it seems like the case is acting up, the charge simply goes to zero without any proper use. This has happened twice with me for now. At one time its green and 100% charged as shown in the case and when I plug it out and put it back in charging it's charging again and stays under red color charging mode for more than 30 minutes, giving a surety that it never was fully charged. Maybe a faulty piece but I will exchange it and see",3
Just wow!,"I would give them a 4.5 if they had the option, but because these are incredible, especially for the price point, I have rounded up.The highs:1. The sound quality is top notch and rivals the AirPods Pro. 2. The case and the buds look gorgeous.3. In ear feel is absolutely fantastic! The mids:1. The sound from the microphone is crisp, with no complaints from callers. 2. Transparency mode works fairly well.3. Battery is average. Lasted me 3.5-4 hours with transparency on while toggling...",5
Terrific purchase,Received mine today at namma mysuru Karnataka. very fast delivery by flipkart. Product quality is good. sounds fine. balanced sound. for 5999 its value for money. All gestures works fine. With ANC On it sounds best. voice calls are good.,5
Great product,I'm not joking but I liked the sound of my wired jbl earphones that were of 650bucks. And this gives much better sound so complaints on that. I know some people are really keen on the sound quality but u have to consider that this is a tws at a price much lower than the airpods or sonys. And considering that I think this gives a pretty much all round performance. I'm in love with the design. Just hope that they last longer coz I am a stringy person and this is the most i have ever spent on a ...,5
Fabulous!,Mind blowing sound for this price range.. Works very well with my mi 11 ultra.. Once again Carl pie proved his best with this device.. Go for it blindly.,5
Does the job,"Got mine delivered just a week ago and have been listening to these on a daily basis. Here's a full review of how it goes:Sound - 4/5Amazing sound signature at the price, these could be compared fairly with other budget options but calling them airpods Pro replacement is far fetched. They are great at what they do and hope the brand grows to understand how to hold different levels of sound. P.S. there's only preset equalizers on the app and cannot customise it whatsoever.Build - 3/5Earp...",3
Great product,"Delighted after arrival, but the touch is a bit too sensitive for my taste as anc turns off even with non capacitive touches of things such as pillows hence switched one tap hold off, sound quality simply put is balanced and immersive to all ears no bass heaviness present and mids sound quite beautiful for the price. But special mention to the level of anc at this price is priceless and also the weight is not too light that you forget you have something in your ears while opening a tshirt and...",5
Good,"Great value for money purchase in this price segment.PROS:-1. Sound is amazing, has a good balance between bass and treble. 2. Very comfortable to ear, can wear it for a longer duration.3. Build quality is good but one might have to wrap it to prevent scratches.CONS:-1. Case is too large to carry in a pocket.2. Battery is average, depends upon ANC.3. Sound leak on volume above 70.4. No google assistance support.5. ANC is average.",3
Delightful,"Best built quality, best sound and bass quality,but I felt bad while  gaming.there is huge latency. I won't recommend these tws ear buds for gaming. For all round purpose it's an best option for that price category. And also  the ANC and transparency mode is the best part in this device. And also I loved the wireless charging feature in this price range. I hope that  we can expect more features through updates",4
Brilliant,"Got this for 4k only.Definitely worth 4k and definitely not worth 7k.😂😂Sound quality is good.Very very comfortable.Bass is not overpowered, which is good.Vocals could have been better.Sounds better than oneplus buds z. But but but the call quality is worst.",5
Value-for-money,"Its a good product as compared to hype, but not ground breaking. Sound quality is good specially bass, and more bass mode enhances it further. Although user eq should had been there. ANC is average to good, nothing to complaint about, nothing to boast about. Lowers the hums, but high pitch sounds enter the ear. Build is good. Battery backup is average at best. Just 4 5 hours max. I have soundcore Life Note bought at 2k and their battery is abt 9 hrs. Connectivity is not good, sometimes it bre...",4
Pretty good,"Believe it or not this really seperate itself apart from the competition with respect to design. However other than this there is nothing extraordinary about this hyped device.Quick details-Sound- Excellent (i feel it balanced)Bass- SatisfactoryDesign- Appealing (definitely)Battery- great backup as claimedVolume control is good.touch responces are ok however three taps to change the songs are not user friendlySoftware is good, gives good option to set noise cancellation, equaliser et...",4
Moderate,After using for the whole day i am here to review the product .+Ve+ Best sound quality+ Best call quality even in busy road with full on traffic+ Best accurate touch gesture (Vol. Up-down / Song next- prev)+ Best comfy. as they sits in ear very well & light weight+ Best software .. gives you lots of customisations like     equaliser and gesture controls.-ve- ANC is descent but not that amongst the best.. Here i want to clear that overall ANC do cut the surrounding noise but not ...,2
Worth every penny,Sound quality is this  price is really amazing just loved them design really great fits in ear really comfortably noise cancellation is also really good worth the money.,5
Delightful,"Overall nice headset. Decent sound quality. Design and wireless charging is great. Touch sensitivity is good. Very comfortable to wear, dosent feel somthing is inside the ear. The ANC is just average. Bass is also average.In ear detection dosent work perfectly, it keeps pausing the song even the headphones are in the ear. Still worth for the money",4
Best in the market!,"The nothing ear (1) sounds, fits and looks beautiful with none of the usual boominess typically found in low end earphones. A somewhat useful ANC, acceptable battery life, intuitive gesture controls, and very surprisingly, no bugs. A few days ago, nothing added an update and the earphones now include an option to trigger the voice assistant! Highly recommended!",5
Horrible,No voice clarity while calling utter disturbance and not audible,1
Awesome,"After buying jabra 75t on the review...wqnted some thing whcoh is comfortable...bought this despite of negetive reviews ..My Review woyld be Excellent where noone can deny the fact that its design is eye catchy....Sound is at par. ANC is satisfactory, comfort is excellent. Battery life is very good. I hope there are the few things we look at most of the time...price is compitative.Have high hopes with nothing to get awesome products same like use to happen in ONEPLUS (once upon a time).",5
Great product,Amazing product. Tried many and settled for nothing. Noise cancellation is awesome,5
Worth every penny,Just Loved it. Definitely go for it.,5
Horrible,"Right ear bud is not working.I received this product before 2-3 days. Today morning when I checked the battery status, it said 10% left in my both ear buds. So I took it the provided type c cable and charged it for 15-20 mins and then I checked the battery status. Ever since then the right ear bud is not working. I tried to reset the device too but it didn't work. I attached the proof, the battery status of the case will be shown only when both ear buds are placed in the case while it is not...",1
Worth every penny,Super,5
Very Good,Overall sound is good for the price with few cons here and therePros:Bass is adequate for my likingMids and Highs are perfectANC is goodBattery life is good. Getting around 3h for buds with 70% volume and total of around 19-22h when ANC is OFFMic is very good for callsDesign and comfort are personal choice and they are perfect for meCons:Custom EQ not availableCase attracts scratches easilyExperiencing very bad battery life on calls.

Just wow!,"After using for it for an week , I'm an IOS User and I'm an huge fan of airpods 2 since I love the tap gesture but some what I didn't feel the complete experience of the music ...i have explored airpods pro and 3 also but nothing has satisfied me .... So I gave an try for this one ..surprisingly it's too good .has an tap gesture and good clarity of music",5

Moderate,"No voice assistant, Lack of customizations in the app, No custom EQ, Low in bass, Connectivity issues, Problem with latency, Distortion at high volumes. Customer expects this basic features which nothing has failed to offer.",2
Nice,"Bass is less and sound quality doesn’t specify the price, ANC is below average",3
Nice,"Bass could be punchier else everything is good in sound.Fitting is nice and I found some issue in call at outside while taking,vice is breaking in mid between.1 start deductied for bass and one star deducted for call quality outside.",3
Bad quality,"Sound quality is not good, it’s not worth for this price",2
Great product,Super,5
Terrific,Im just disappointed by the battery backup of the buds. It lasts for around 3 hrs. Which is a decent time. But my requirements are a bit more than that. Everything else was satisfactory.,5
Perfect product!,Best choice if don't have budget to buy Apple pods,5
Worth every penny,Value for money Good product under 6k I'm impressed 👍,5
Very Good,Good,4
Pretty good,Good,4
Wonderful,"Well, I got it for 4999 and at this price just go for it. Thanks to Flipkart for the fast delivery even in this part of the country. As for the product and the quality of sound it gives, let me be honest - It did not sound like AR Rahman was singing right beside me but it does sound like I am in a live concert. The Nothing Ear app does nothing other than setting the equalizer. Touch controls are just a waste of technology on this device though, completely useless. It does not even try to dist...",4
Brilliant,Value for money and nice design,5
Classy product,"These buds are truly amazing, best value for money. These are not the best in the industry as the price we are paying is far less. You won't regret buying these.",5
